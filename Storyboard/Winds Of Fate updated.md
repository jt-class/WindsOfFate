Chapter 1: The Nightmare












August 24, 2024  - Mari Luzviminda, a 17-year-old girl from the Philippines, wakes in the middle of a violent super typhoon. The wind howls like a living thing, and the rain lashes against her window with a force that makes the glass rattle. The house around her groans as if struggling to stay together. Confused and frightened, Mari stumbles out of bed, her heart pounding as she tries to make sense of the chaos.
Mari: "Oh no, what's happening? It feels like this storm will kill us all. The wind is howling so loud, and the house is shaking. I can’t believe how strong the rain is hitting the window. I have to get out of here!"
————————-
The storm outside is unlike anything she’s ever seen. The world beyond her window is a blur of water and wind, and she can barely make out the shapes of buildings and trees bending under the force of the typhoon. She tries to reach for her phone, but there’s no signal, no way to call for help. A deep sense of dread settles in her stomach.
Mari: "I can’t see anything outside. It’s all just a blur of water and wind. I can't even reach my phone—there’s no signal. This dread... it's suffocating. I don’t know what to do. How can I call for help?"
————————-
As she stands frozen, trying to figure out what to do, something strange happens. Her vision blurs, and suddenly she’s overwhelmed by a vivid image—a vision that feels too real to be just a figment of her imagination. She sees herself standing on the rooftop of the ESTIAI University, the tallest structure in her city, which is now known as ESTIAI University.
Mari: "What is this? My vision is blurring, and now I’m on the rooftop of the STI building. Is this a dream? The city is completely submerged. How could this happen?"
————————-
From this high vantage point, she looks out over the city of Dasmariñas, and what she sees makes her blood run cold.
Mari: "This is awful. The city is underwater, and there’s so much debris. People are drowning, clinging to rooftops, and being swept away. The sound of the storm is drowning out everything. It’s all so devastating."
The entire city is submerged under floodwaters. Streets she once knew are now rivers, churning with debris—cars, broken furniture, and uprooted trees. The water is everywhere, drowning everything in its path. Mari can hear the distant cries of people, their voices muffled by the roar of the storm. Some are clinging to rooftops, others are being swept away by the relentless current. The scene is one of utter devastation.
————————-
Mari: "I’m back in my room, but that vision... it felt so real. My hands are glowing, but I don’t understand why. I can’t stay here; I have to get to the ESTIAI University building. It might be my only chance."
The vision is so intense, so real, that it leaves Mari gasping for breath when it finally fades. She’s back in her bedroom at her house, but the memory of the flooded city lingers in her mind, too vivid to ignore. She looks down at her hands, and to her shock, they’re glowing with a soft, eerie light. She doesn’t understand what’s happening, but she knows one thing—she can’t stay here.
————————-
Mari: "If the city is going to flood like in my vision, the ESTIAI University building might be the only place high enough to stay safe. I need to get out of here."
The memory of the ESTIAI University building, standing tall above the floodwaters, pulls her into action. If the city is going to flood like in her vision, the ESTIAI University building might be the only place high enough to stay safe. She rushes out of her house, into the storm, the glow in her hands pulsing as if guiding her through the chaos.
————————
Mari: "The streets are turning into rivers. The rain is relentless. People are shouting, and the water is rising too quickly. I have to get through this chaos and make it to the university. I have to survive."
Outside, the world is already falling apart. The streets are turning into rivers, the rain coming down so hard it feels like it might tear through her skin. She can hear the cries of her neighbors, the panicked shouts of people trying to escape. But the water is rising fast, faster than anyone can react.
———————
Mari: "Everything around me is destroyed—cars are half-submerged, power lines are sparking, and trees are uprooted. This place is a nightmare. I need to get to my friends, but the storm is making it impossible."
As Mari fights her way through the storm, she sees signs of destruction everywhere—cars are half-submerged, their headlights flickering weakly in the water; power lines are down, sparking dangerously; trees have been torn from the ground, their roots exposed like broken limbs. The world around her is a nightmare come to life.
———————-
Aurora: “Mari! Over here! The water’s rising too fast! We’re trapped! Help us, please! We need to get out of here before it’s too late.”
Josh: “Mari, don’t give up on us! We’re stuck, and the water’s coming up so quickly. I don’t know how much longer we can stay here.”
Kurt: “Mari, hurry! The water’s getting higher, and it’s so cold. We’re losing our grip”
Mari: "There they are—Aurora, Josh, and Kurt. They’re trapped, and I can’t reach them. The water’s too strong. Oh no, I see it again—the vision of them being swept away. I can’t let this happen."
She turns a corner and spots a group of her closest friends—Aurora Averill, Josh Majica, and Kurt Hendrix. Relief floods through her, but it’s short-lived. They’re trapped, the water already up to their waists, and the current is too strong for them to move. Mari tries to reach them, but the force of the water is overwhelming, pushing her back.
————————
Mari: "The vision is happening again. The water is rising, and they’re being dragged under. Their screams... I can hear them. I can’t save them. Time is rewinding, but it’s all playing out the same. Why can’t I change anything?"
Panic surges through her, and then, without warning, she has another vision. She sees the water surge even higher, sweeping her friends off their feet, dragging them under. Their screams for help are cut short as they disappear beneath the surface, swallowed by the flood. The vision is so real, so immediate, that it leaves Mari reeling.
———————-
Mari: "I failed. I saw the flood,I tried, but it wasn’t enough (sobbing). My friends are gone. I’m left here with nothing but this power that couldn’t help. I have to keep moving. I have to reach the university."
She loses hope all of to her friends as they drown in the abyss of the Flood, as she tried to reach to the top of the University the glow in her hands intensifies. Instinctively, she raises her hand, willing herself to do something, anything, to save them. The world around her shudders, and suddenly, time rewinds. The water recedes slightly, and she’s back to a moment before the surge. But even with this second chance, she can’t reach them in time. The scene plays out exactly as she saw it—her friends are swept away, their bodies disappearing into the dark, swirling water.
Mari: "Finally, I’m at the university. The entrance is underwater, but I have to push through. I have to climb. I can’t stop now. I need to get to the rooftop. I need to see if my vision was true."
————————-
Mari collapses to her knees, the glow in her hands fading as exhaustion and grief wash over her. The power to rewind time was real, but it wasn’t enough. Her friends are gone, lost to the storm, and she’s left alone in the rising water, their final screams echoing in her mind.
Mari: "I’m on the rooftop. The city is completely submerged. My friends are gone, my home is destroyed. This thing in my hand... What am I going to do now?"
Desperate and broken, Mari forces herself to her feet. She has to keep moving, has to survive, if only to make sense of what’s happening to her. The vision of the ESTIAI University building, still standing above the flood, drives her forward. She stumbles through the water, each step harder than the last, as the storm continues to batter the city.
She finally reach the Top of the building, she sees all of the houses and people washed away by the flood and she is the only survivor
Mari: What is the reason why did you give me this vision?? (crying as she remembers how her friends die drowning)

CHAPTER 1.2: The Butterfly’s Mask




AUGUST 14,2024 
( A week before it happens)
Exhausted, grief-stricken, and confused, Mari’s world fades to black as she loses consciousness.
When Mari awakens, she’s no longer on the rooftop. She’s back. she wakes up in the classroom where she sees her classmates and friends, she cant believe what she dream
Mari: "Where am I? Back in the classroom? It felt so real—was it just a dream or a mere Nightmare? a dream in another dream (confuse) but My hands still glow. I can’t stay here. I need answers. I need to figure out what’s happening to me."
She looks down at her hands, half-expecting the glow to be gone, but it’s still there, faint but undeniable. Panic sets in. She can’t stay here, not like this, not knowing what’s happening to her. Ignoring the curious glances of her classmates, including Victoria Viotto, Ian Trongcoso, Emma Pierce, and Dylan Piece, who are usually quick to bully her, Mari bolts from the room, her mind reeling with the memories of the storm, the loss of her friends, and the terrifying power she doesn’t understand.
———-
Mari: "I’m leaving. My classmates are staring, and I can’t explain this. I don’t understand what’s going on with me. I have to find out. I have to get out of here and find some answers."
Larry Villarreal, her professor, watches in confusion as she flees, not knowing what to do. 
Larry Villarreal watched in confusion as Mari Luzviminda bolted from the classroom. His brow furrowed in concern.
Larry Villarreal: “What just happened? Why did she run out like that? Is everything alright?”
With a worried glance around the room, Larry began to gather his thoughts. Meanwhile, Mari raced down the hallway, her heart pounding with a mix of fear and determination. The strange butterfly was still fluttering ahead of her, guiding her through the chaos in her mind.


DECISION 1 (Aurora’s Path to Mari)
Mari: “I need to follow  this butterfly. Maybe it’s leading me to something important.”(decision1) 
She followed the butterfly to the nearest restroom. The faint glow in her hands flickered in the dim light. As she entered, she noticed the faucet over the sink. She turned it on, letting the water flow freely, creating a gentle but growing flood on the bathroom floor. The sound of the running water seemed to calm her racing thoughts, though the rising water was beginning to worry her.
Mari watched as the water pooled around her feet, rising steadily. The butterfly landed delicately on her wrist, its wings fluttering softly. Mari stared in awe as the insect seemed to settle there, and with a sudden, inexplicable sensation, a small blue butterfly tattoo appeared on her wrist, exactly resembling the one that had guided her.
Mari: “What is this? Why is this happening to me?”
Before she could fully grasp the significance of the tattoo, the restroom door swung open. Aurora Averill, running late, burst in, her eyes widening in shock as she saw the flooded restroom.
Aurora: “Mari, what’s going on? The water—” (decision 1)
Aurora’s foot slipped on the wet floor, and she lost her balance. She fell hard, hitting her head against the tile with a sickening thud. The impact was brutal, and Aurora lay unconscious, her body still and unmoving amidst the rising water.
Mari’s eyes widened in horror as she witnessed the scene. The reality of Aurora’s death, the same death she had feared, hit her with a wave of helplessness.
Mari: “No! Not again! I have to do something!”
In a panic, she raised her hands, the glowing light intensifying as she desperately wished to undo the tragedy. The world around her shimmered, and time began to rewind. The water receded, the butterfly vanished from her wrist, and Aurora’s body was lifted from the floor as if being pulled backward in time.
Mari: “I can’t believe it’s happening again. Is this power really going to save her?”
Before Mari could fully comprehend the situation, she found herself back in the classroom, sitting at her desk. The clock ticked away, and everything seemed to have returned to normal. Aurora, along with her other classmates, was present, chatting and laughing as if nothing had happened. Mari looked down at her hands, no longer glowing, and saw that the tattoo had disappeared.
Mari: “Am I back in the classroom? Was it all just a dream? Did I really go back in time?”
Confused and exhausted, Mari looked around the classroom, trying to piece together the fragments of her fragmented memories. The class continued as if nothing unusual had occurred. Mari’s heart raced with the realization that she had somehow rewound time again, but the exact nature of her powers remained a mystery.
She took a deep breath, struggling to steady her nerves. With a determined resolve, she knew she had to understand her abilities and what had led her to this point. She needed answers, and she couldn’t waste any more time.
Mari: “I need to find out what’s happening to me. I have to understand this power and what it means.”
Determined to uncover the truth, Mari stood up from her desk, her mind racing with the possibilities of what lay ahead. The classroom seemed oddly normal, but Mari was far from reassured. She had experienced a devastating glimpse into the future and managed to alter it, but the mystery of her powers was only beginning to unfold.
As Mari left the classroom, she knew her journey was far from over. She had to delve deeper into the enigma of her abilities and uncover the truth behind the visions and the strange, glowing power she possessed. The path ahead was uncertain, but Mari was ready to face whatever challenges awaited her.
 
DECISION 2: JOSH PATH TO MARI
Context: (She will see the butterfly but she will not mind it, then if she doesn't go to the comfort room or restroom aurora will not see her and later on die): and josh will ask her whats wrong (Josh path)




The chapter ends with Mari fleeing the school, desperate for answers, and terrified of what she might discover.






Chapter 2: The Unveiling









Mari Luzviminda stumbled through the school hallways, her thoughts swirling in a haze of confusion and fear. She had just witnessed a terrible future and managed to rewind time, but the power and its implications were overwhelming. Her hands still felt the residual glow, though it had faded, leaving only the memory of its strange warmth.
Determined to make sense of everything, Mari knew she needed to confide in someone she deeply trusted. That someone was Aurora Averill. Their friendship had always been a source of solace for Mari, and the undercurrent of unspoken affection between them added a layer of complexity to their bond. Aurora had always been more than just a friend; she was a confidante, a source of support, and the one person who seemed to understand Mari in a way no one else did.
Mari found Aurora waiting for her at their usual meeting spot – an old, secluded gazebo in the city park. The gazebo had once been a place of laughter and shared secrets, a sanctuary away from the world’s troubles. Today, it seemed more like a refuge from the storm raging inside Mari’s heart.
Aurora: “Mari, what’s going on? I’ve been worried sick.”
Mari’s gaze was intense, her words coming out with an urgency that matched her distress.
Mari: “Aurora, there’s something I need to show you. It’s… it’s important!”
Mari took a deep breath and began explaining her powers. She described how she had discovered she could see glimpses of the future and rewind time. Aurora listened intently, her initial skepticism gradually giving way to curiosity.(decision 1: she tells aurora about the power)
Aurora: “You’re telling me that you can actually see the future and alter events?”
Mari nodded, her expression filled with determination.
Mari: “Yes, but I know it sounds unbelievable. I need to show you how it works. Please, trust me.”
Mari took a deep breath and demonstrated her ability. She focused on a small stone lying on the ground, and with a wave of her hand, it levitated briefly before returning to its original place.
Aurora: “This is incredible. I’ve never seen anything like it.”
Mari smiled, relieved to see Aurora’s belief in her powers growing.
Mari: “There’s more. I can also rewind time. It’s… it’s a bit more complicated.”
Aurora: “Rewind time? How does that even work?”
Mari explained that she could manipulate time to undo events, but it wasn’t perfect. To demonstrate, she picked up a small plant nearby, dropped it, and then rewound time to see it gently return to its original state.
Aurora: “So, you can actually go back and change things?”
Mari nodded, her face a mix of hope and apprehension.
Mari: “Yes, but it’s not always easy. I tried to save my friends before, but I couldn’t change everything. I thought that if I could understand this better, maybe I could make a difference.”
Aurora’s eyes softened as she considered Mari’s words. The gravity of Mari’s power was becoming clearer, and she could see the weight of responsibility it carried.
Aurora: “Mari, this is extraordinary. It’s also deeply unsettling. You need to be cautious with this ability.”
Mari nodded, her eyes reflecting the weight of her newfound responsibility.
Aurora: “But if you can control it, if you can understand it, maybe you can use it to make things better. You have this power for a reason.”
Mari’s voice was shaky, revealing her inner turmoil.
Mari: “I don’t know how to control it fully. I just… I wanted to show you so you would believe me. I need to figure out how to use it properly.”
Aurora placed a hand on Mari’s shoulder, squeezing it gently.
Aurora: “We’ll figure this out together. You’re not alone in this, Mari.”
The two of them sat in silence for a moment, the weight of the situation pressing down on them. The gazebo, usually their place of comfort, now felt more like a war room where they were planning something monumental. The storm had passed, but the air was still thick with the scent of rain and the tension of unspoken fears.
decision 2 (she will not say the power of time to aurora at the same time it gives doubt to the people around her but josh will be curious (aurora’s dialogue will become josh’s dialogue)): 

(THE 2.1 ENDS HERE, A STOPPING POINT THAT FOCUSES ON MARI REVEALING HER POWERS,.SETTING THE STAGE ON WHAT'S TO COME)
















CHAPTER 2.2 THE STIRRING









Decision 1():
Aurora: “We need to understand your powers. If you can see the future and rewind time, there has to be a way to use that to make things better. But first, let’s get back to our houses. We need to grab a change of clothes and anything else we might need before we dive into this.
Mari nodded in silent agreement, her thoughts too tangled to form words. Together, they began the walk back, the weight of their new reality pressing down on them with every step.
As they neared the familiar streets, a figure appeared in the distance. It was Bellatrix Wilkes, a classmate from school. The three girls exchanged brief, polite greetings, the kind that were customary but held no real meaning. Bellatrix, always observant, watched as Mari and Aurora continued on their way. But something nagged at her—a sense that something was off. The memory of their faces lingered in her mind, the tightness around their eyes, the hurried pace of their steps. There was a shadow of panic there, subtle but unmistakable. Bellatrix couldn’t shake the feeling that something was very wrong.
Mari arrived at the front of her house, her mind a whirlwind of confusion and fear. She hesitated, unsure of what to say to her mother. After a moment of deliberation, she decided it was safer to keep her silence. She couldn’t risk dragging her mother into the danger that loomed over her.
Stepping inside, Mari saw her mother, Mary Luzviminda, sitting on the couch, engrossed in a television show. But as soon as their eyes met, her mother’s expression shifted to one of concern.
Mary Luzviminda: “Is there a problem? You’re sweating a lot.”
Mari forced a smile, hoping it would ease her mother’s suspicions.
Mari: “No, Mom, there’s nothing wrong. I’m just exhausted from school.”
Mary Luzviminda studied her daughter for a moment, clearly unconvinced, but decided to let it go.
Mary Luzviminda: “I cooked some food. Make sure you eat,” she said, her tone gentle but firm.
Mari nodded, barely whispering a “yes” in response. She retreated to her room, needing a moment alone to collect her thoughts, to try and make sense of the chaos that had suddenly become her life.
During their conversation, they were unaware that Bellatrix Wilkes, one of Mari's classmates, was listening from a distance. Her curiosity was piqued by Mari’s revelation of her powers. Surprised and envious, Bellatrix decided to share this intriguing piece of information with Ian, one of the bullies in their class. She quickly made her way to where Ian was hanging out with his friends.
Bellatrix: “Ian, I need to tell you something.”
Ian looked up, interested.
Ian: “What is it?”
Bellatrix leaned in and whispered.
Bellatrix: “Come closer. I’ll tell you.”
Ian moved in, his eyes widening with surprise.
Ian: “Oh, is it true?” (His face broke into a grin.)
Bellatrix nodded, her excitement palpable. Ian's mind began racing, and he decided to involve his two companions, Emma and Victoria, in this new scheme. The three bullies gathered to discuss their plan.
Ian: “We should check out Mari and Aurora. Let’s see what trouble we can stir up.”
Victoria, who had a crush on Josh, blushed slightly but was intrigued by the idea.
Victoria: “Ah, well, that’s possible.”
Emma, known for her tough demeanor, added with a smirk.
Emma: “Forget the snacks; let’s just go. Victoria seems eager to treat us.”
Victoria: “Just enough with the cheap stuff, okay!!!” (She said this with a mix of annoyance and excitement.)
Ian: “Oh no! Come on, it’s such a waste. Let’s go, Josh. I’ve got something I want to tell you later.”
Josh, who had been nearby, looked puzzled.
Josh: “What is it?”
Ian: “I’ll explain in the canteen. Come on, or Victoria might just pee from excitement!” (Ian laughed.)
As they made their way to the canteen, Ian mulled over what he had overheard.
Ian: “I wonder why she has that?”
The canteen was bustling with noise as other students from different grades were on their recess. The four of them lined up to buy snacks.
Emma: “Victoria’s treating us, so just a biscuit and water for me.” (She smiled while looking for a place to sit.)
Victoria: “Oh yes.”
Ian: “Same for me. Thanks, Victoria.” (He grinned, knowing he didn’t have money for snacks.)
Victoria turned to Josh.
Victoria: “Josh, what about you?”
Josh: “Oh, I didn’t realize I’m already full because I ate a biscuit earlier.”
Victoria: “Oh, is that so?” (She responded with mild disappointment.)
Emma: “Oh, right. There’s an empty space over there.”
Ian: “Let’s go.”
Once they were seated, Ian brought up the topic again.
Ian: “Josh, are Mari and Aurora your friends?”
Josh: “Oh, why?”
Ian: “It’s nothing. I just overheard their conversation earlier on the school rooftop.”
Josh: “What were they talking about?”
Ian’s expression grew serious.
Ian: “I heard Mari say she has powers.”
Josh: “Huh? Where would she get that?”
Ian: “I don’t know.”
Josh: “Maybe it was just your imagination.”
Ian: “Maybe so. Victoria is taking so long to buy.”
A silent moment followed until Bellatrix had a sudden idea.
Ian: Josh! Josh: what! Ian: Aren't those two your best friends?
Josh: Oh, why?
Ian :Ask them about that; maybe they'll tell you too since you're best friends, right? I saw Victoria heading out with her purchases.
Victoria:Sorry for the delay, there are a lot of students buying. * Emma and Ian received their free snacks.*
 Emma: Thank you, Victoria!
 Ian:Thank you, Victoria! 
Victoria:You really!(galit na mukha nito) 
Ian: Hurry up and eat so we can go back to the room. * scene sa room*
Bellatrix:Why does she have powers?
The question lingered in the air as the group settled into their usual spots, each person absorbed in their own thoughts and plans, while the atmosphere buzzed with anticipation and curiosity.

(aurora path)
The girls dive into research, seeking to understand the origins and potential consequences of Mari’s powers. They spend late nights combing through old books, online forums, and talking to local elders. They uncover stories of others with similar abilities, but none as strong as Mari’s. They learn that these powers come at a cost—each change Mari makes to the future causes unintended side effects. The tension grows as Mari begins to doubt whether she should use her powers at all. The chapter highlights the growing urgency of their mission and the strain it places on their relationship.

Mari wakes up from a nap, utterly remembers what happened hours ago, grabs her phone, and calls her friend's number.

Sound: Ringing Phone

From the other line:
Aurora: “Why did you call Mari?”

Mari stands up,
Mari: “I just got more curious about this ability and what are the possible things I can do with this power. That’s why I called you so you can help me to find out more about this power.”
Mari said in a curious voice.

Aurora: “Okay, I’ll help you but first let me get my Laptop.”, Aurora responded.

Mari sat on her study table and opened her laptop,
Mari: “Sure, take your time.” Mari said to her friend.

The two start searching for the origin of the ability that Mari gained. As they browsed the internet they just got a pinch of information about what the power can do so they decided to go to the library in their locality. They gather the books that correlate with what Mari's power is and the two start reading but in the end, they just get a piece of information and they are not convinced that this is just the information they can gather for this ability to fully reveal its full potential until Aurora got information about a certain barrio in their locality, information about someone named Corason. As they search for Corason who is knowledgeable about the power they come to an old house with dead trees. Without being cautious to their surrounding, someone is following their tracks in everywhere they go, someone who have a dark intention towards Mari.

Bellatrix: “What are this two doing here?” she asks herself and continues to follow Mari and Aurora in a street full of dead trees.

Mari and Aurora continue to follow the address that being said in the textbook they read.

Mari: “Is this the right address?” Mari asked and Aurora just nodded with an expression of scared plastered in her face.

Aurora: “Are you sure we are going into that house?” Aurora asked with a shaky voice and grabbed Mari’s arm.

Mari: “I don’t have a choice and I want to fill my curiosity with why this power got onto me.” Mari said.

Aurora: “Okay, I’ll go with you but if anything happens use your power okay?”. Mari just nodded to what Aurora said.

The two entered the premises of the house of Corazon, and  the heavy feeling from the entrance of the location got more and more condense as they got to the front door of the house. Aurora got more clinging to Mari’s arm as they approached the door.

Aurora: “Can we go back?” Aurora asked Mari but the latter is persistent to know about the truth with her power.
Mari: “We are already here.” Mari smiled at Aurora to ease her worries.

Mari knocks on the wooden door but no one responds from the inside. Mari again knocks on the door but again the same answer is no one responds from the knocking. Until Mari feels a presence in their back and someone touches their shoulder.

Mari, startled by the sudden touch, turns around to find Aurora clinging to her arm, her face pale with fear. 

Mari: "Aurora, what's wrong?" Mari asks, her voice filled with concern.

Aurora, still trembling, whispers, 
Aurora: "I think I saw something. A ghost."

Aurora: “MARI!” Aurora shouts while clinging more to Mari’s arm.

Bellatrix walks away from the house, a smirk playing on her lips. She had seen enough to know that Mari and Aurora were up to something. As she walks, she plans to share her discovery with her followers, ensuring that they will do everything in their power to stop the girls.

Mari: "We're here to... to ask for help," Mari stammers, her voice barely audible. 
Manang Corazon's eyes narrow as she examines Mari and Aurora. She's seen her share of strange things in her lifetime, but this is different. There's something about Mari that feels familiar, almost as if she's met her before.


Mari and Aurora: "There's something wrong with the house." they whispered.

Manang Corazon's expression softens.
Manang Corazon: "Come in, then. Let's talk."
Manang Corazon said and she opened the wooden door. The two ladies behind her look at each other and they go inside the house. The saying, “Don’t judge the book by its cover” flustered Mari and Aurora's faces as they entered the house. From the outside, the house looks like it’s going to fall apart but when you enter the house you will be astonished by its elegance and beauty.

Mari and Aurora: “Wow! It’s beautiful!” Mari and Aurora said at the same time.

Manang Corazon: “Come here, lady…” Manang Corazon said while looking at Mari. Mari came forward, she reached the couch, and sat in the location where Corazon 's patted. “What is your name?” Corazon asked the fine lady in front of her. The lady smiled and told her name.

Mari: “Mari Luzviminda.”


The old woman nods, her expression unreadable as she takes in Mari’s name. There’s a moment of silence, thick with anticipation, as Mari waits for Corazon to speak.
Manang Corazon: “You’ve come seeking answers about your power. I can see it in your eyes: the confusion, the fear. But you must understand, this power you possess is not without its price.”
Mari’s heart races. She had expected to find answers, but the gravity in Corazon’s voice fills her with a new kind of dread.
Mari: “What do you mean, a price?”
Manang Corazon: “Every time you change the future, there are consequences. Some small, some... devastating. This power is not to be used lightly, for each ripple you create in time can turn into a storm.”
Aurora, who has been silently listening, finally speaks up, her voice trembling.
Aurora: “So, what should we do? How can Mari control it?”
Manang Corazon: “Control is an illusion. The best you can do is understand the weight of your actions and choose wisely. There are stories—people like you who tried to change their fate, only to bring about greater suffering. But... there are also tales of those who found a way to live with it, to bear the burden without breaking.”
Mari’s mind swirls with the implications of Corazon’s words. She had hoped for clear answers, a guide to mastering her abilities, but instead, she’s faced with more uncertainty.
Mari: “So, what should I do?”
Manang Corazon: “You must decide for yourself, child. The power is yours, and so is the responsibility. But remember, every choice you make echoes through time. Choose wisely, and you may find peace. Choose recklessly, and you may lose everything.”
The weight of Corazon’s words settles over Mari like a heavy blanket. She had sought understanding, and while she had gained some insight, she now realized that her journey was just beginning. The true challenge was not merely in using her power, but in navigating the moral and emotional labyrinth it created.
As they leave Corazon’s house, the air feels thick with the knowledge of what they have   learned. Mari and Aurora walk in silence, each lost in their thoughts. The world around them seems darker, more dangerous than before, as the realization sinks in: Mari’s power is both a gift and a curse, and how she uses it could change everything—for better or for worse.

Chapter 3.2: The Burden of Power



Her house, her mind still swirling with the weight of her new reality. She glanced back at Aurora, who gave her an encouraging nod before heading to her own home. Mari knew she couldn’t waste any time. She needed to understand her powers, and fast.
Mari’s House
Inside, Mari found her mother, Mary Luzviminda, sitting at the kitchen table, looking exhausted. The strain of raising Mari alone and the constant fear of the storms had taken its toll on her. Mari hesitated, not wanting to burden her mother with her newfound abilities, but she knew she couldn’t hide the truth forever.
Mary: “Mari, you look pale. Is everything alright?”
Mari forced a smile, trying to mask the fear coursing through her veins.
Mari: “Yeah, Mom. Just a lot on my mind. I’m going to my room for a bit.”
Mary watched her daughter disappear down the hallway, sensing that something was off but unsure of how to approach it. Mari’s room was her sanctuary, filled with memories, pictures of her friends, and mementos of simpler times. She sat on her bed, staring at her glowing hands, trying to grasp the magnitude of her powers. Her thoughts drifted back to her visions—the flooded city, the screams, the helplessness.
House of Aurora
Meanwhile, Aurora returned home, her mind still reeling from everything Mari had shown her. She knew they had to act fast, but she also knew that Mari needed a friend, someone to ground her amidst the chaos. Aurora gathered a few essentials, her thoughts lingering on Mari’s powers and the potential they held. She wasn’t just going to stand by, she was going to help Mari, no matter the cost.
City of Nectarville
Back in the city, the storm clouds that had once loomed ominously over Nectarville were gone, but the air remained tense, as if the city itself was holding its breath. Mari stood at her window, looking out at the streets that had once seemed so familiar but now felt foreign and threatening. The glowing in her hands flickered faintly, a reminder of the power she wielded and the heavy responsibility that came with it.
The Weight of Choices
Mari sat on the edge of her bed, the room’s silence pressing down on her like a heavy weight. The revelation from Corazon replayed in her mind – each ripple in time carried consequences she couldn’t predict. The gravity of it all was almost too much to bear.
Her gaze drifted to her glowing hands, a stark reminder of the power she now held and the responsibility that accompanied it. The idea that every choice she made could have far-reaching effects was both daunting and paralyzing. She could no longer see her life as it once was, simple and predictable. Now, every action, every decision seemed to carry a ripple effect she struggled to comprehend.
Mari’s phone buzzed on the nightstand, snapping her out of her thoughts. She picked it up with trembling fingers and dialed Aurora’s number. The line rang several times before Aurora’s voice, filled with concern, answered.
Aurora: “Her, Mari. Is everything okay?”
Mari: Her voice strained and quivering: “I need your help. I’ve been thinking about what Corazon said. I can’t just ignore this. I need to do something, but I don’t know where to start. Can we meet up?”
Aurora: “Of course,” Aurora replied immediately. “Let’s meet at the park. It’s quiet there, and we can think things through without any distractions.”
As she ended the call, Mari felt a flicker of relief at Aurora’s willingness to help. As she prepared to leave, her eyes wandered to the framed photos on her bedside table – snapshot of simpler times with friends and family. They felt like a lifetime ago now, a stark contrast to the turmoil she was experiencing.
She stepped out of the house, her thoughts racing. The street outside was quiet, bathed in the soft glow of the evening. As she walked towards the park, she glanced back at her home through the window near the front door. Her mother, Mary Luzviminda, was still sitting at the kitchen table, her posture slumped and her face etched with a deep, unspoken worry. Mari’s heart ached with the weight of the secret she was carrying. She wanted to protect her mother from the truth, but she also knew she couldn’t keep living this double life.
With a deep breath, Mari turned away and headed towards the park. Each step felt heavy, laden with the weight of the choices she had to make. The park was a few blocks away, a sanctuary of sorts amidst the chaos of her life. As she approached, she hoped that the quiet and the company of her friend might offer some clarity in this swirling storm of uncertainty.
Mari arrived at the park, the cool evening breeze brushing against her face as she took in the familiar surroundings. The park, with its gently rustling leaves and the soft glow of streetlights, offered a momentary reprieve from the chaos swirling within her. Aurora was already there, sitting on a bench and scanning the horizon, her expression a mixture of concern and anticipation.
Mari approached, and Aurora looked up, her eyes reflecting a blend of empathy and determination. Without a word, Mari sat beside her, and for a moment, they simply sat in silence, allowing the tranquility of the park to settle their nerves.
Mari: Her voice barely more than a whisper: “I don’t know where to start. The weight of everything is just too much.”
Aurora: Placing a reassuring hand on Mari’s shoulder: “We’ll figure this out together. But first, let’s focus on what you need to do now. It’s clear that Corazon’s warning wasn’t just a precaution; it’s something we need to take seriously.”
Mari nodded, her eyes fixed on the distant horizon.
Mari: Voice tinged with worry: “I feel like I have this power, but I’m still just a kid. I don’t know how to control it or understand its full scope. What if I make things worse?”
Aurora: Squeezing her shoulder gently: “The fact that you’re aware of the potential consequences shows that you’re already thinking wisely. We’ll take it one step at a time. We need to explore what you’re capable of and find a way to use it responsibly.”
As they talked, the reality of their situation began to sink in. Mari knew that her powers had the potential to change everything, but she was unprepared for the responsibility that came with them. The fear of unintended consequences weighed heavily on her, and the thought of her relationship with Aurora being tested by her own actions was a sobering realization.
Together, they watched as the sun set over the park, the darkness encroaching as the day gave way to night. The park, once a place of solace, now seemed to symbolize the uncertainty of their future. Mari and Aurora’s friendship, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos, was now intertwined with the very powers Mari struggled to control.
With a final, resolute look at the horizon, Mari stood up.
Mari: Determined: “We need to figure out how to use my powers without causing harm. If we don’t, we might end up making everything worse.”
Aurora: Nodding, standing beside her: “We will. We’ll face this challenge together, and we’ll make sure that whatever changes we make are for the better.”
As they walked away from the park, their silhouettes merging with the encroaching darkness, Mari felt a renewed sense of determination. She knew that the path ahead was fraught with danger and uncertainty, but with Aurora by her side, she was ready to confront whatever lay ahead.
The weight of her choices was immense, but Mari was prepared to face the consequences. Little did she know that her next steps would lead her into a whirlwind of altered realities and strained relationships, pushing her powers to the limit and testing the very fabric of her existence.

Chapter 4: Premonition



(Aurora path)
The park was bathed in the soft glow of twilight as Mari and Aurora decided to head home. As they walked, Mari couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss. She had a sense of foreboding, a premonition that something terrible was about to happen.
Aurora: “Are you okay, Mari?” (concerned look) noticing the troubled look on her face.
Mari: “I’m fine.” (smiles) trying to reassure her but deep down, she knew she wasn’t.
They exchanged goodbyes and parted ways. As Mari reached the bus stop, a familiar chill ran down her spine. She remembered the night of the typhoon as she realized the same thing might happen again soon. She knew she had to do something to prevent it, but she wasn’t sure what.
She hopped on the bus and went to her favorite area of the bus, at the back beside the window. Alone inside the bus, she thought of attempting to awaken her power, but to no avail, nothing happened. Thinking about her powers and trying to make an attempt to awaken them overwhelmed her, so she pulled out her headphones, hoping to distract herself from the intrusive thoughts that haunted her and started to drift off to sleep. But little did she know, the desperation to know about her powers and her constant thoughts of wanting to go back to the time of the typhoon led her to the place she truly desired, the nightmare she once experienced.
A wave of dizziness washed over her. When she opened her eyes, she found herself back on the night of the typhoon.
Mari: “I am back again on the day of the typhoon! I shouldn’t waste this time to modify the past once again.”
She rushed towards ESTIAI University, the floodwaters rising rapidly behind her. She had to save her friends, no matter the cost. The memory of their terrified faces, their desperate cries for help, was etched into her mind.
As she approached the university, the chaos was overwhelming. People were shouting, panic was setting in. Mari scanned the crowd, searching for her friends.
Mari: “I need to save my friends from drowning, I cannot afford to lose them again just like before.”
Aurora: “Mari! Over here! The water’s rising too fast! We’re trapped! Help us, please! We need to get out of here before it’s too late.”
Josh: “Mari, don’t give up on us! We’re stuck, and the water’s coming up so quickly. I don’t know how much longer we can stay here.”
Kurt: “Mari, hurry! The water’s getting higher, and it’s so cold. We’re losing our grip”
Mari: “Don’t give up! I’m here!” Her voice barely audible over the wind.
But even though she had arrived early, the storm's intensity was overwhelming. The floodwaters were rising faster than she could have imagined.
Mari: “Think, Mari, think! There has to be a way.”
Mari's mind raced. She knew she had to find a way to save her friends.
*Suddenly, the bus stopped and she woke up abruptly. The bus had come to a stop at a red light. Mari had been lost in thought, her mind wandering through the memories of her past dreams. Suddenly, she felt a cold sensation on her arm. She looked up to see Bellatrix and Ian, two notorious bullies from her school, standing over her. 
Ian: "Well, well, well," he sneered. 
Bellatrix: "Looks like you're in a bit of a pickle, Mari."
Mari tried to ignore them, but their presence made her uncomfortable.
Mari: "What do you want?" she asked, her voice trembling.
Ian: "Oh, nothing much. Just thought I'd come along and see how you're doing. Maybe even have a little fun at your expense." he laughed.
Mari: "Leave me alone." trying to sound confident.
But Bellatrix and Ian were not to be deterred. They started to question Mari about her dreams, mocking her for being so easily scared.
Ian: "What did you dream about, Mari?" his voice dripping with sarcasm.
Mari tried to ignore them, but they persisted. 
Bellatrix: "Come on, tell us," her eyes sparkling with mischief.
Mari hesitated. She didn't want to share her dreams with them, especially about her visions. But she knew that if she didn't, they would never let her go.
Mari: "I... I don't remember." she stammered.
Bellatrix and Ian exchanged a knowing glance. 
Ian: "Oh, really? That's a shame. I was hoping you had something interesting to share."
Bellatrix: "We know you're hiding something from us, Mari.", her voice is low and menacing.
Mari tried to act calm, but her heart was pounding in her chest. 
Mari: "What are you talking about?"
Ian: "We know you've been having weird dreams. And we know you're hiding something about your powers." he smirked. 
Mari's eyes widened in shock. How did they know about her dreams? And how did they know about her powers?
Mari: "How do you know about my dreams?", her voice trembling.
Bellatrix and Ian exchanged a glance. 
Bellatrix: "We have our sources."
Mari knew that she was in trouble. Bellatrix and Ian were blackmailing her. If she didn't tell them about her dreams and her powers, they would make her life a living hell.
Mari: "I don't know what you're talking about.", trying to bluff.
But Bellatrix and Ian were not to be fooled. They pushed Mari against the bus window and began to threaten her.
Bellatrix: "Tell us what you know, Mari, or else..." , her voice filled with menace.
Just as it seemed like the situation was going to escalate, she hurriedly got off the bus.
Mari sighed in relief. She was safe for now, but she knew that Bellatrix and Ian would not give up. She would have to be more careful in the future.
While walking, she thought about the scenario that had just happened. 
Mari: I need to say what I had just dreamt about to Aurora.
Mary Luzviminda’s voice filled the room as her daughter entered. "Welcome home, my daughter!" she said with a bright smile, her eyes reflecting a mother's joy. The scent of food filled the air, and without skipping a beat, she asked, "Have you eaten?"
Mari responded casually, "I'm not hungry yet."
Mary Luzviminda raised an eyebrow but kept her tone light. "Is that so? Go ahead and change over there so we can eat." She gestured toward a small hallway that led to Mari’s bedroom.
As Mari entered her room, the wooden floor creaked slightly under her feet. She glanced at her bed, neatly made, with soft linens that smelled faintly of lavender. She took her time, enjoying the familiar comfort of home.
Impatiently, Mary Luzviminda called from the kitchen, "Mari! What's taking you so long to change? Hurry up, or this food I cooked will get cold."
From inside the room, Mari responded, "Yes, mom!" She quickly finished changing into more comfortable clothes and stepped back out into the cozy living room.
As she emerged, her mother was already at the dining table, adjusting the placement of the dishes. The food was laid out, steaming lightly, ready to be enjoyed. Mary Luzviminda looked up and said with a mock sternness, "Oh, just sit there and eat. Please turn on the TV; it's been raining a lot, there might be a storm."
Mari nodded and reached for the remote, turning on the old television in the corner. The screen flickered to life, and the low hum of the weather report filled the room. As the rain outside intensified, they began to eat together, the warmth of the meal contrasting with the cool, damp air outside.
*The next morning, sunlight peeked through the thin curtains of Mari's room, gently stirring her from sleep. As she sat up, the events from the previous day on the bus flashed through her mind. Her heart raced for a moment, and she realized she had to leave early. Quickly, she got out of bed and hurried through her morning routine, pulling on her uniform and gathering her books. The house was still quiet, with only the faint sounds of the city waking up beyond the walls.

Once outside, the cool morning air greeted her as she walked toward the school. The streets were damp from the previous night's rain, and a light breeze rustled the leaves. As she approached the school gate, she spotted Aurora and Josh walking together, talking and laughing. The sight of them side by side made Mari quicken her pace.
Just as they neared the gate, Mari called out, "Good morning, Aurora! And to you, Josh."
Aurora turned, her face lighting up with a warm smile. "Good morning!"
Josh gave a nod and echoed, "Good morning!"
Mari, catching up with them, suggested, "Let's go together."
The three of them walked through the school gates, their footsteps in sync as they made their way down the bustling hallway. Students were scattered everywhere, chatting, laughing, and rushing to their classes. As soon as they entered the classroom, Mari and Aurora immediately took their usual seats, Mari sitting beside Aurora.
After a few moments of silence, Mari leaned over, her voice low but urgent. "It happened again," she whispered.
Aurora turned to her with a curious expression, her eyebrows furrowing slightly. "Which one?"
Mari sighed softly, her thoughts racing. "There are so many possibilities that could happen," she said cryptically, her eyes glancing out the window, as if lost in thought.
Aurora tilted her head, confusion etched across her face. "Like what?" she asked, her tone puzzled.
Mari pointed out to Aurora that the teacher will enter the room. Then, Aurora looks at the door and quickly fixes her seat. Aurora glanced at Mari and said “Later, tell me everything that happened.”

*The sudden blare of the school alarm echoed through the hallways, signaling the end of their current class. The students around them quickly packed up their belongings, shuffling papers and notebooks into their bags as they prepared to head to their next class. The room buzzed with chatter and the scraping of chairs on the floor.
Aurora, however, wasn’t ready to let their conversation drop. She walked over to where Mari was still seated, deep in thought, and gently tapped her shoulder. “Now, tell me everything,” Aurora said, her voice serious but filled with concern. “We still have 20 minutes before our next class starts.”
Mari hesitated for a moment, glancing around the nearly empty room before taking a deep breath. She began recounting her recurring dreams—the strange, vivid visions of the future that seemed more real with each passing night. She explained how in her dreams, she saw terrifying possibilities, disasters that might happen, and people she cared about getting hurt.
Aurora listened carefully, her expression growing more troubled with every word. “What will you do?” she finally asked, her voice barely above a whisper.
Mari shook her head, unsure. "I don’t know… but I’ll try to figure out the best thing I can do to save all of you," she said, her voice wavering with uncertainty. Even as she spoke, she could feel the weight of the responsibility pressing down on her, and her mind raced with what-ifs. What if she was too late? What if she made the wrong choice?
Aurora sighed deeply, her brow furrowing as she processed everything Mari had just said. Then, after a moment of silence, she made a firm decision. "Okay, but I’m going to help you," Aurora said with conviction. "I can’t just stand by and let you deal with this on your own, especially if you're seeing something so terrible in the future."
Mari looked up, grateful but also worried. “Aurora, this is dangerous. I don’t want to put you in harm's way.”
Aurora shook her head, her expression unwavering. “I don’t care. If lives are at stake, we need to do something. You’re not alone in this.”
Before Mari could argue further, Aurora suddenly grabbed her hand and pulled her. "Come on," she said with a small, encouraging smile. "Our next class starts in 5 minutes. Let’s focus on that for now. We’ll figure out the rest later."
They hurried out of the classroom, walking briskly down the bustling hallway filled with students. The air was charged with the familiar sounds of lockers closing and conversations mixing together, but Mari's mind was still swimming with thoughts about the future. Yet, with Aurora by her side, she felt a little more grounded, as if she wasn’t facing her fears alone anymore.
As they walked toward their next class, Mari couldn’t shake the feeling that something was coming—something big. But for now, she pushed those thoughts aside, focusing on the sound of their footsteps echoing in the hallway and the comfort of Aurora’s steady presence next to her. 
As Mari and Aurora hurried to their next class, History, they couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss. They had a sense of foreboding, a premonition that something terrible was about to happen.
Mari: "Do you think we might find answers in the library?" her voice barely audible over the noise of the hallway.
Aurora:  "Maybe. We could try looking for ancient texts or historical records. Something might be there." nodded, her eyes filled with hope.
As they entered the library, they were greeted by a quiet, serene atmosphere. The shelves were filled with books, their spines worn with age. Mari and Aurora began to search for ancient texts, hoping to find clues about Mari's powers and the strange visions she was experiencing.
Hours turned into days as they delved deeper into the library's vast collection. They discovered hidden passages, secret chambers, and ancient symbols etched into the walls. Mari felt a growing connection to the library, as if it held the key to unlocking her destiny.
One evening, as they were about to leave the library, a sudden gust of wind rattled the windows. A chill ran down Mari's spine as she felt a surge of energy within her. She knew it was time.
Mari: "Aurora, I think we need to go," her voice barely audible over the howling wind.
Aurora: "Let's go." nodded, her eyes filled with determination.
They rushed out of the library, the rain pouring down around them. The streets were deserted, save for the occasional flash of lightning. As they made their way towards the outskirts of the city, Mari felt a strange sense of calm wash over her. It was as if she was being guided towards something important.
When they reached the outskirts of the city, the scene was a stark contrast to the peaceful campus they were used to. The floodwaters were rising rapidly, and people were panicking.
As they fought their way through the surging waters, Mari felt a surge of energy within her. And in that moment, she knew that their journey had only just begun.

Chapter 5: Revelations/Exodus (climax)

CLIMAX
DECISION 1: AURORA'S PATH

The sky churned like a living beast, casting deep shadows over Nectarville as the typhoon raged on. Mari stood atop the roof of ESTIAI University, the tallest structure in the city, her hands glowing with the familiar yet terrifying power of time. The wind howled, nearly drowning out the sounds of the floodwaters below, crashing through the streets and sweeping away everything in their path.

Beside her, Aurora watched the destruction unfold, her voice barely audible over the storm. Aurora (pleading): “Mari, we have to do something! The city is going under. This storm—it’s worse than anything we’ve ever seen.”

Mari’s heart pounded in her chest. She had seen this moment countless times in her visions, and no matter how hard she tried, the future always brought her back to this rooftop, to this impossible choice. The weight of it was unbearable.

Mari (shouting over the wind): “I’ve tried, Aurora. I’ve tried everything! No matter what I do, it all leads back here.”

Her voice trembled as the glow from her hands flickered, the raw power surging through her body. She had rewound time so many times—too many times. Each attempt to save the city, to save her friends, seemed to make the storm worse, the devastation more complete. Now, standing here with Aurora, it felt like the end of everything.

Aurora (grabbing Mari’s arm): “You can’t give up! There has to be a way. You have the power, Mari. You just need to use it.”

Mari turned to Aurora, her best friend, the girl she loved more than anyone in the world. The thought of losing her was unbearable. But the thought of sacrificing everything else—the city, their friends—was just as devastating.

Mari (voice breaking): “But what if… what if I can’t? What if no matter what I choose, someone has to be lost?”

Aurora’s grip tightened, her eyes full of fear but also hope. Aurora: “We’ll figure it out. You’re not alone in this.”

The storm’s fury seemed to intensify, the wind whipping around them as if urging Mari to act. Below, the city of Nectarville was already submerged in places, the floodwaters climbing higher and higher, swallowing homes, cars, and lives. She could hear the faint cries of the people trapped below, and her heart ached with the weight of their desperation.

Mari: “It’s happening again. Just like in my vision… it’s all happening again.”

She took a step back, her eyes scanning the horizon, the chaotic scene playing out before her exactly as she had seen it before. The power in her hands surged again, the familiar pull of time beckoning her to rewind, to try again. But how many times had she tried? How many times had she failed to change the outcome?

Aurora (urgently): “Mari, we’re running out of time! You can’t hesitate now!”

Mari felt the pressure mounting. She knew Aurora was right—there was no more time to second-guess herself. The storm was relentless, and soon the city would be completely submerged. She had to act, but every choice felt like a trap.

She looked into Aurora’s eyes, her heart breaking. Mari (softly): “I’m scared.”

Aurora: “I know. But you’re the only one who can stop this. You have to trust yourself.”

Mari’s mind raced, the possibilities spinning around her. She could feel the weight of every decision pressing down on her—each choice pulling her in a different direction, each with its own devastating cost. No matter what she did, someone would pay the price.

She turned her gaze to the city, her chest tightening with the crushing reality of what was at stake. If she rewound time again, there was no guarantee she could save everyone. And what if she couldn’t save Aurora? What if this was the last time she could even try?

Mari (whispering): “How do I choose? How do I decide who to save?”

The glow in her hands intensified as her power reached its peak. She could feel the storm pushing back against her, a force of nature as unstoppable as time itself. The wind howled, and the floodwaters surged higher. The city was slipping away, drowning beneath the weight of the storm.

Aurora (desperate): “Mari, please! Whatever you’re going to do, do it now!”

The choice loomed before her, as vast and terrifying as the storm itself. Mari knew that this was it—the moment she had been dreading. She couldn’t rewind anymore. She couldn’t run from the decision.

She looked at Aurora, her heart breaking with the knowledge that whatever she did, someone would be lost.

The storm raged on, and in that moment, Mari made her final choice.



DECISION 2: JOSH PATH 


FOUR POSSIBLE  endings:
(Aurora path)
Decision 1. Sacrifice Her Lover – Save the Town and Herself
 
The storm clouds churned violently above the city, and the rooftop of the STI building groaned under the weight of the rising winds. Mari stood with Aurora by her side, her glowing hands trembling. They had been through so much together—discovered powers, faced danger, and clung to each other in the darkest moments. Now, they stood on the brink of a choice that would forever alter their lives.
 Mari’s heart felt as if it were being torn apart. She could see the city below, drowning in floodwaters, and the cries of the people echoed in her mind. She had the power to rewind time, to stop the storm, to save everyone. But there was a cost, and that cost was Aurora.

 Aurora looked at Mari, her expression filled with a painful resolve. She stepped closer, gripping Mari’s hand tightly. “Mari, you have to do it,” Aurora whispered, her voice barely audible over the roar of the storm. “You can save them all. You can save yourself.”

Mari shook her head, tears spilling down her cheeks. “I don’t want to live without you. I can’t.”

 
Aurora smiled softly, though tears filled her eyes too. “You have to. It’s the only way. If I’m gone, you’ll survive. You’ll stop the storm, and all of this—” She gestured to the chaotic scene around them. “—it will have been for something.”

 “But… Aurora, I love you.” The words fell from Mari’s lips, desperate and raw.


“I love you too,” Aurora whispered, stepping closer and cupping Mari’s face in her hands. “And that’s why you have to let me go. For the greater good.”

 
Mari hesitated, her heart screaming in protest, but she knew Aurora was right. She had the power to fix everything, but it would come at the most unbearable price. With a choked sob, she raised her glowing hands.

 “I’m so sorry,” Mari whispered, her voice breaking as she prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice.
 
The moment her powers surged, time unraveled around them. Aurora’s face blurred, her body fading away like mist in the wind. Mari tried to hold on, but it was like grasping at air. In a flash, Aurora was gone—her love, her partner, erased from existence as if she had never been.


The storm ceased, the floodwaters pulled back, and the city was saved. Mari collapsed to her knees on the now-quiet rooftop, sobbing uncontrollably. The world was at peace, but her heart was shattered. She had saved everyone—everyone but the one person she couldn’t live without.
Mari stands atop the ESTIAI University building, witnessing the destruction caused by a devastating typhoon flooding the city of Nectarville. Her hands glow with the power of time manipulation, a power she has used repeatedly in failed attempts to prevent this disaster. Despite rewinding time countless times, every attempt brings her back to this exact moment, where she faces an impossible choice.



Decision 2. Sacrifice the Town – Save Herself and Her Lover
 
The winds howled as the floodwaters climbed higher, engulfing everything in their path. Mari and Aurora stood on the rooftop of the STI building, watching in horror as the city was swallowed by the storm. Time was running out, and Mari could feel the pressure mounting in her chest. She had the power to stop this, to save the city and its people—but the thought of losing Aurora was too much to bear.

Aurora’s hand tightened around Mari’s, her eyes pleading. “Mari, you can fix this! You have to stop the storm!”

Mari shook her head, her breath coming in short, desperate gasps. “No. I can’t. Not if it means losing you.”

Aurora’s face contorted in shock. “What? Mari, think about what you’re saying! There are thousands of people down there. You can save them! You have to!”

But Mari couldn’t. The memory of Aurora’s smile, the warmth of her embrace, the laughter they had shared—it was all too precious. She couldn’t let that go. She couldn’t live in a world without Aurora, even if it meant condemning the town to destruction.


“I won’t do it,” Mari said, her voice cracking. “I can’t lose you again, Aurora. I’d rather—”

Aurora’s eyes widened in disbelief. “Mari, no. You can’t sacrifice all those people for me. Please, don’t do this.”

But Mari was already stepping back, her glowing hands dimming as she made her decision. “I’m sorry, Aurora. I need you. I need us.”

The storm surged, stronger and more violent than ever before. The waters swallowed the city whole, drowning homes, cars, and people. Mari’s heart ached as she heard the distant cries, but she didn’t move. She couldn’t.

As the floodwaters rose to the rooftop, Mari wrapped her arms around Aurora, pulling her close. “We’ll survive this, together,” she whispered, her voice trembling with fear and guilt.

 
Aurora, torn between anger and heartbreak, clung to Mari, knowing that the choice had been made. They watched as the city was consumed, the devastation complete. In the end, they were the only ones left—together, but at a terrible, irreversible cost.
Aurora, by her side, urges Mari to act and use her powers to stop the storm, but Mari is torn. Each option she considers carries an immense cost—whether it's the city, her friends, or Aurora herself. Mari's fear of losing Aurora conflicts with her duty to save the city. With the storm intensifying, the floodwaters rising, and the cries of those trapped below growing louder, Mari realizes she has no time left to hesitate.
 
Decision 3. Sacrifice Herself – Save Her Lover and the Town
 
The wind howled, the floodwaters surging beneath them. The rooftops of the city were barely visible as the storm bore down with unrelenting fury. Mari and Aurora stood on the edge of the STI building’s roof, their clothes drenched from the rain. Mari’s hands glowed with an eerie light, the power within her screaming for release.
 
“I can’t let this happen,” Mari murmured, more to herself than to Aurora. She turned to face her, her heart heavy with the weight of the decision she knew she had to make. “I have to stop the storm. But… I have to do it alone.”
 
Aurora shook her head, panic filling her eyes. “No, Mari. We can figure this out together. There has to be another way.”
 
“There isn’t.” Mari’s voice broke. She stepped toward Aurora, her hands still glowing with the power that could change everything. “The only way to save the town, to save you, is for me to give up… everything.”
 
Aurora’s breath caught in her throat. “What do you mean?”
 
“If I sacrifice myself,” Mari whispered, her voice shaking, “I can stop the storm. I can rewind time and prevent it from ever happening. But I won’t be here when it’s over. I’ll disappear, Aurora.”
 
“No!” Aurora cried, grabbing Mari’s hand and pulling her close. “You can’t do that! You can’t leave me! There has to be another way!”
 
Mari closed her eyes, tears mingling with the rain on her face. “I love you. More than anything. But this is the only way to save you, to save everyone.”
 
Aurora’s voice cracked as she begged, “Please, Mari. Don’t leave me. I can’t do this without you.”
 
“You’ll have to.” Mari’s heart broke as she stepped back, her hands glowing brighter, her power reaching its peak. “I’m doing this for you. For the town. I can’t let everyone die because of me.”
 
The world seemed to pause as Mari raised her hands. The glow became blinding, and the air hummed with energy. Time itself bent to her will as she made the ultimate sacrifice.
 
Aurora reached out, tears streaming down her face. “Mari, no!”
 
But it was too late. In a brilliant flash of light, the storm stopped. The winds died down, the floodwaters receded, and the city was saved. Time had been rewound, and the disaster had never happened. But Mari was gone.
 
Aurora collapsed to her knees on the rooftop, the silence of the storm’s aftermath pressing down on her. Mari had saved them all, but she had vanished, erased from existence. The girl who had loved her, the girl who had fought so hard to save the town, was gone forever.
 
Alone on the rooftop, Aurora sobbed, clutching the spot where Mari had stood just moments before. The city was safe, the storm was over, but her heart was shattered. Mari had given everything to save them, and now she was nothing more than a memory.
The pressure of the decision weighs heavily on Mari, as she fears that no matter what she chooses, someone will be lost. She is scared and unsure, but Aurora reassures her that she must trust herself and make the choice. As the storm reaches its peak and time pulls at her, Mari understands that she can no longer run from this decision. With her heart breaking, she looks at Aurora one last time and makes her final choice.
DECISION 4 (Josh path) 
The wind roared like a beast unleashed, tearing through Nectarville as the typhoon raged on. Mari stood at the top of the ESTIAI University building, her hands glowing with the familiar yet overwhelming power of time. The floodwaters below were merciless, swallowing buildings, streets, and lives. Destruction was everywhere.

Beside her stood Josh, his face pale but determined. He glanced at Mari’s glowing hands, knowing that this power was the only thing that stood between the city’s salvation and its complete annihilation. He’d seen Mari struggle before, watched her rewind time, trying desperately to change the course of events. But each attempt had only brought them back to this rooftop, to this moment.
Josh (shouting over the storm): “Mari, you have to do something! This storm is going to take everything!”
Mari’s heart raced, her mind clouded with panic. She had seen this moment in her visions too many times—countless rewinds, countless failures. No matter how hard she tried, the future always dragged her back here, to this rooftop, to this impossible decision. The weight of it was unbearable.

Mari (shouting back): “I’ve tried, Josh! I’ve tried everything! Every time I rewind, it gets worse. No matter what I do, it all leads back here.”

Her voice cracked as the glow from her hands flickered, the raw power surging within her. She had rewound time so many times that it felt like her soul was being torn apart by the consequences. And now, standing here with Josh, she felt trapped, powerless to change the inevitable.

Josh (grabbing her arm): “You can’t give up! You’ve come too far. You’ve saved us before, Mari. You have the power—use it!”

Mari turned to face him, her best friend, the boy who had been there through everything, standing beside her even as the world crumbled around them. She had never wanted this. She never wanted the burden of deciding the fate of so many lives. The city, her friends, Josh—how could she possibly choose between them?

Mari (her voice shaking): “What if no matter what I choose, I lose someone? What if I can’t save you? What if I can’t save anyone?”

Josh’s grip tightened on her arm, his eyes full of determination despite the fear that lurked behind them. Josh: “You don’t have to figure it all out right now. We don’t have time for that. But what you can do is trust yourself. You’re the only one who can stop this.”

The wind howled louder, urging Mari to act. Below them, the floodwaters continued to rise, swallowing everything in their path. The city of Nectarville was already half underwater, and the people trapped below screamed for help that might never come. Every second they waited was another second closer to complete devastation.

Mari (panicking): “It’s happening again. Just like in my vision… It’s all happening again.”

She took a step back, her eyes scanning the horizon, the chaos unfolding below just as she had seen it before. Every detail was the same—the destruction, the fear, the helplessness. Time was slipping away, and she knew that she had no more chances to rewind. This was it.

Josh (urgently): “Mari, we’re running out of time! You can’t freeze up now—you have to act!”

Mari could feel the pressure mounting, the storm closing in around them. Josh was right—there was no more room for hesitation. But every choice she saw before her felt like a trap. If she used her powers again, who would she lose? Who would be sacrificed this time?

She turned to Josh, her heart breaking. Mari (softly): “I’m scared.”

Josh’s expression softened, but there was still determination in his eyes. Josh: “I know you’re scared. But you’ve faced worse before. You can do this. You’ve always been the one who could change everything.”

Mari’s mind raced, her thoughts spinning like the storm around them. She could feel the weight of each decision pressing down on her, pulling her in different directions. No matter what she did, there would be consequences. And no matter what choice she made, someone would be lost.

She glanced at Josh, his face full of trust, his belief in her unwavering. He had always stood by her, always believed in her, even when she doubted herself. But now, as she looked at him, she knew that this might be the last time they stood together.

Mari (whispering): “How do I choose? How do I decide who to save?”

The glow in her hands flared brighter as her power reached its peak. She could feel the storm fighting back, a force of nature as unstoppable as time itself. The wind whipped around them, the floodwaters rising higher, threatening to engulf the entire city.

Josh (desperate): “Mari, please! Whatever you’re going to do, do it now!”

The moment of decision loomed before her, as vast and terrifying as the storm itself. Mari knew that this was the end—the moment she had been running from. She couldn’t rewind anymore. She couldn’t run from the responsibility that had been placed on her shoulders.

Her eyes met Josh’s one final time, knowing that whatever she did next would change everything.

The storm raged on, and in that moment, Mari made her final choice.
