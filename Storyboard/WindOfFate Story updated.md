Chapter 1: The Nightmare


August 24, 2024  - Mari Luzviminda, a 17-year-old girl from the Philippines, wakes in the middle of a violent super typhoon. The wind howls like a living thing, and the rain lashes against her window with a force that makes the glass rattle. The house around her groans as if struggling to stay together. Confused and frightened, Mari stumbles out of bed, her heart pounding as she tries to make sense of the chaos.
Mari: "Oh no, what's happening? It feels like this storm will kill us all. The wind is howling so loud, and the house is shaking. I can’t believe how strong the rain is hitting the window. I have to get out of here!"
————————-
The storm outside is unlike anything she’s ever seen. The world beyond her window is a blur of water and wind, and she can barely make out the shapes of buildings and trees bending under the force of the typhoon. She tries to reach for her phone, but there’s no signal, no way to call for help. A deep sense of dread settles in her stomach.
Mari: "I can’t see anything outside. It’s all just a blur of water and wind. I can't even reach my phone—there’s no signal. This dread... it's suffocating. I don’t know what to do. How can I call for help?"
————————-
As she stands frozen, trying to figure out what to do, something strange happens. Her vision blurs, and suddenly she’s overwhelmed by a vivid image—a vision that feels too real to be just a figment of her imagination. She sees herself standing on the rooftop of the ESTIAI University, the tallest structure in her city, which is now known as ESTIAI University.
Mari: "What is this? My vision is blurring, and now I’m on the rooftop of the STI building. Is this a dream? The city is completely submerged. How could this happen?"
————————-
From this high vantage point, she looks out over the city of Dasmariñas, and what she sees makes her blood run cold.
Mari: "This is awful. The city is underwater, and there’s so much debris. People are drowning, clinging to rooftops, and being swept away. The sound of the storm is drowning out everything. It’s all so devastating."
The entire city is submerged under floodwaters. Streets she once knew are now rivers, churning with debris—cars, broken furniture, and uprooted trees. The water is everywhere, drowning everything in its path. Mari can hear the distant cries of people, their voices muffled by the roar of the storm. Some are clinging to rooftops, others are being swept away by the relentless current. The scene is one of utter devastation.
————————-
Mari: "I’m back in my room, but that vision... it felt so real. My hands are glowing, but I don’t understand why. I can’t stay here; I have to get to the ESTIAI University building. It might be my only chance."
The vision is so intense, so real, that it leaves Mari gasping for breath when it finally fades. She’s back in her bedroom at her house, but the memory of the flooded city lingers in her mind, too vivid to ignore. She looks down at her hands, and to her shock, they’re glowing with a soft, eerie light. She doesn’t understand what’s happening, but she knows one thing—she can’t stay here.
————————-
Mari: "if the city is going to flood like in my vision, the ESTIAI University building might be the only place high enough to stay safe. I need to get out of here."
The memory of the ESTIAI University building, standing tall above the floodwaters, pulls her into action. If the city is going to flood like in her vision, the ESTIAI University building might be the only place high enough to stay safe. She rushes out of her house, into the storm, the glow in her hands pulsing as if guiding her through the chaos.
————————
Mari: "The streets are turning into rivers. The rain is relentless. People are shouting, and the water is rising too quickly. I have to get through this chaos and make it to the university. I have to survive."
Outside, the world is already falling apart. The streets are turning into rivers, the rain coming down so hard it feels like it might tear through her skin. She can hear the cries of her neighbors, the panicked shouts of people trying to escape. But the water is rising fast, faster than anyone can react.
———————
Mari: "Everything around me is destroyed—cars are half-submerged, power lines are sparking, and trees are uprooted. This place is a nightmare. I need to get to my friends, but the storm is making it impossible."
As Mari fights her way through the storm, she sees signs of destruction everywhere—cars are half-submerged, their headlights flickering weakly in the water; power lines are down, sparking dangerously; trees have been torn from the ground, their roots exposed like broken limbs. The world around her is a nightmare come to life.
———————-
Aurora: “Mari! Over here! The water’s rising too fast! We’re trapped! Help us, please! We need to get out of here before it’s too late.”
Josh: “Mari, don’t give up on us! We’re stuck, and the water’s coming up so quickly. I don’t know how much longer we can stay here.”
Kurt: “Mari, hurry! The water’s getting higher, and it’s so cold. We’re losing our grip”
Mari: "There they are—Aurora, Josh, and Kurt. They’re trapped, and I can’t reach them. The water’s too strong. Oh no, I see it again—the vision of them being swept away. I can’t let this happen."
She turns a corner and spots a group of her closest friends—Aurora Averill, Josh Majica, and Kurt Hendrix. Relief floods through her, but it’s short-lived. They’re trapped, the water already up to their waists, and the current is too strong for them to move. Mari tries to reach them, but the force of the water is overwhelming, pushing her back.
————————
Mari: "The vision is happening again. The water is rising, and they’re being dragged under. Their screams... I can hear them. I can’t save them. Time is rewinding, but it’s all playing out the same. Why can’t I change anything?"
Panic surges through her, and then, without warning, she has another vision. She sees the water surge even higher, sweeping her friends off their feet, dragging them under. Their screams for help are cut short as they disappear beneath the surface, swallowed by the flood. The vision is so real, so immediate, that it leaves Mari reeling.
———————-
Mari: "I failed. I saw the flood,I tried, but it wasn’t enough (sobbing). My friends are gone. I’m left here with nothing but this power that couldn’t help. I have to keep moving. I have to reach the university."
She loses hope all of to her friends as they drown in the abyss of the Flood, as she tried to reach to the top of the University the glow in her hands intensifies. Instinctively, she raises her hand, willing herself to do something, anything, to save them. The world around her shudders, and suddenly, time rewinds. The water recedes slightly, and she’s back to a moment before the surge. But even with this second chance, she can’t reach them in time. The scene plays out exactly as she saw it—her friends are swept away, their bodies disappearing into the dark, swirling water.
Mari: "Finally, I’m at the university. The entrance is underwater, but I have to push through. I have to climb. I can’t stop now. I need to get to the rooftop. I need to see if my vision was true."
————————-
Mari collapses to her knees, the glow in her hands fading as exhaustion and grief wash over her. The power to rewind time was real, but it wasn’t enough. Her friends are gone, lost to the storm, and she’s left alone in the rising water, their final screams echoing in her mind.
Mari: "I’m on the rooftop. The city is completely submerged. My friends are gone, my home is destroyed. This thing in my hand... What am I going to do now?"
Desperate and broken, Mari forces herself to her feet. She has to keep moving, has to survive, if only to make sense of what’s happening to her. The vision of the ESTIAI University building, still standing above the flood, drives her forward. She stumbles through the water, each step harder than the last, as the storm continues to batter the city.
She finally reach the Top of the building, she sees all of the houses and people washed away by the flood and she is the only survivor
Mari: What is the reason why did you give me this vision?? (crying as she remembers how her friends die drowning)

CHAPTER 1.2: The Butterfly’s Mask
AUGUST 14,2024 
( A week before it happens)
Exhausted, grief-stricken, and confused, Mari’s world fades to black as she loses consciousness.
When Mari awakens, she’s no longer on the rooftop. She’s back. she wakes up in the classroom where she sees her classmates and friends, she cant believe what she dream
Mari: "Where am I? Back in the classroom? It felt so real—was it just a dream or a mere Nightmare? a dream in another dream (confuse) but My hands still glow. I can’t stay here. I need answers. I need to figure out what’s happening to me."
She looks down at her hands, half-expecting the glow to be gone, but it’s still there, faint but undeniable. Panic sets in. She can’t stay here, not like this, not knowing what’s happening to her. Ignoring the curious glances of her classmates, including Victoria Viotto, Ian Trongcoso, Emma Pierce, and Dylan Piece, who are usually quick to bully her, Mari bolts from the room, her mind reeling with the memories of the storm, the loss of her friends, and the terrifying power she doesn’t understand.
———-
Mari: "I’m leaving. My classmates are staring, and I can’t explain this. I don’t understand what’s going on with me. I have to find out. I have to get out of here and find some answers."
Larry Villarreal, her professor, watches in confusion as she flees, not knowing what to do. 
Larry Villarreal watched in confusion as Mari Luzviminda bolted from the classroom. His brow furrowed in concern.
Larry Villarreal: “What just happened? Why did she run out like that? Is everything alright?”
With a worried glance around the room, Larry began to gather his thoughts. Meanwhile, Mari raced down the hallway, her heart pounding with a mix of fear and determination. The strange butterfly was still fluttering ahead of her, guiding her through the chaos in her mind.
Mari: “I need to follow this butterfly. Maybe it’s leading me to something important.”
She followed the butterfly to the nearest restroom. The faint glow in her hands flickered in the dim light. As she entered, she noticed the faucet over the sink. She turned it on, letting the water flow freely, creating a gentle but growing flood on the bathroom floor. The sound of the running water seemed to calm her racing thoughts, though the rising water was beginning to worry her.
Mari watched as the water pooled around her feet, rising steadily. The butterfly landed delicately on her wrist, its wings fluttering softly. Mari stared in awe as the insect seemed to settle there, and with a sudden, inexplicable sensation, a small blue butterfly tattoo appeared on her wrist, exactly resembling the one that had guided her.
Mari: “What is this? Why is this happening to me?”
Before she could fully grasp the significance of the tattoo, the restroom door swung open. Aurora Averill, running late, burst in, her eyes widening in shock as she saw the flooded restroom.
Aurora: “Mari, what’s going on? The water—”
Aurora’s foot slipped on the wet floor, and she lost her balance. She fell hard, hitting her head against the tile with a sickening thud. The impact was brutal, and Aurora lay unconscious, her body still and unmoving amidst the rising water.
Mari’s eyes widened in horror as she witnessed the scene. The reality of Aurora’s death, the same death she had feared, hit her with a wave of helplessness.
Mari: “No! Not again! I have to do something!”
In a panic, she raised her hands, the glowing light intensifying as she desperately wished to undo the tragedy. The world around her shimmered, and time began to rewind. The water receded, the butterfly vanished from her wrist, and Aurora’s body was lifted from the floor as if being pulled backward in time.
Mari: “I can’t believe it’s happening again. Is this power really going to save her?”
Before Mari could fully comprehend the situation, she found herself back in the classroom, sitting at her desk. The clock ticked away, and everything seemed to have returned to normal. Aurora, along with her other classmates, was present, chatting and laughing as if nothing had happened. Mari looked down at her hands, no longer glowing, and saw that the tattoo had disappeared.
Mari: “Am I back in the classroom? Was it all just a dream? Did I really go back in time?”
Confused and exhausted, Mari looked around the classroom, trying to piece together the fragments of her fragmented memories. The class continued as if nothing unusual had occurred. Mari’s heart raced with the realization that she had somehow rewound time again, but the exact nature of her powers remained a mystery.
She took a deep breath, struggling to steady her nerves. With a determined resolve, she knew she had to understand her abilities and what had led her to this point. She needed answers, and she couldn’t waste any more time.
Mari: “I need to find out what’s happening to me. I have to understand this power and what it means.”
Determined to uncover the truth, Mari stood up from her desk, her mind racing with the possibilities of what lay ahead. The classroom seemed oddly normal, but Mari was far from reassured. She had experienced a devastating glimpse into the future and managed to alter it, but the mystery of her powers was only beginning to unfold.
As Mari left the classroom, she knew her journey was far from over. She had to delve deeper into the enigma of her abilities and uncover the truth behind the visions and the strange, glowing power she possessed. The path ahead was uncertain, but Mari was ready to face whatever challenges awaited her.
 


The chapter ends with Mari fleeing the school, desperate for answers, and terrified of what she might discover.





Chapter 2: The Unveiling

Mari Luzviminda stumbled through the school hallways, her thoughts swirling in a haze of confusion and fear. She had just witnessed a terrible future and managed to rewind time, but the power and its implications were overwhelming. Her hands still felt the residual glow, though it had faded, leaving only the memory of its strange warmth.
Determined to make sense of everything, Mari knew she needed to confide in someone she deeply trusted. That someone was Aurora Averill. Their friendship had always been a source of solace for Mari, and the undercurrent of unspoken affection between them added a layer of complexity to their bond. Aurora had always been more than just a friend; she was a confidante, a source of support, and the one person who seemed to understand Mari in a way no one else did.
Mari found Aurora waiting for her at their usual meeting spot – an old, secluded gazebo in the city park. The gazebo had once been a place of laughter and shared secrets, a sanctuary away from the world’s troubles. Today, it seemed more like a refuge from the storm raging inside Mari’s heart.
Aurora: “Mari, what’s going on? I’ve been worried sick.”
Mari’s gaze was intense, her words coming out with an urgency that matched her distress.
Mari: “Aurora, there’s something I need to show you. It’s… it’s important!”
Mari took a deep breath and began explaining her powers. She described how she had discovered she could see glimpses of the future and rewind time. Aurora listened intently, her initial skepticism gradually giving way to curiosity.
Aurora: “You’re telling me that you can actually see the future and alter events?”
Mari nodded, her expression filled with determination.
Mari: “Yes, but I know it sounds unbelievable. I need to show you how it works. Please, trust me.”
Mari took a deep breath and demonstrated her ability. She focused on a small stone lying on the ground, and with a wave of her hand, it levitated briefly before returning to its original place.
Aurora: “This is incredible. I’ve never seen anything like it.”
Mari smiled, relieved to see Aurora’s belief in her powers growing.
Mari: “There’s more. I can also rewind time. It’s… it’s a bit more complicated.”
Aurora: “Rewind time? How does that even work?”
Mari explained that she could manipulate time to undo events, but it wasn’t perfect. To demonstrate, she picked up a small plant nearby, dropped it, and then rewound time to see it gently return to its original state.
Aurora: “So, you can actually go back and change things?”
Mari nodded, her face a mix of hope and apprehension.
Mari: “Yes, but it’s not always easy. I tried to save my friends before, but I couldn’t change everything. I thought that if I could understand this better, maybe I could make a difference.”
Aurora’s eyes softened as she considered Mari’s words. The gravity of Mari’s power was becoming clearer, and she could see the weight of responsibility it carried.
Aurora: “Mari, this is extraordinary. It’s also deeply unsettling. You need to be cautious with this ability.”
Mari nodded, her eyes reflecting the weight of her newfound responsibility.
Aurora: “But if you can control it, if you can understand it, maybe you can use it to make things better. You have this power for a reason.”
Mari’s voice was shaky, revealing her inner turmoil.
Mari: “I don’t know how to control it fully. I just… I wanted to show you so you would believe me. I need to figure out how to use it properly.”
Aurora placed a hand on Mari’s shoulder, squeezing it gently.
Aurora: “We’ll figure this out together. You’re not alone in this, Mari.”
The two of them sat in silence for a moment, the weight of the situation pressing down on them. The gazebo, usually their place of comfort, now felt more like a war room where they were planning something monumental. The storm had passed, but the air was still thick with the scent of rain and the tension of unspoken fears.

(THE 2.1 ENDS HERE, A STOPPING POINT THAT FOCUSES ON MARI REVEALING HER POWERS,.SETTING THE STAGE ON WHAT'S TO COME)

CHAPTER 2.2 THE STIRRING

Aurora: “We need to understand your powers. If you can see the future and rewind time, there has to be a way to use that to make things better. But first, let’s get back to our houses. We need to grab a change of clothes and anything else we might need before we dive into this.
Mari nodded in silent agreement, her thoughts too tangled to form words. Together, they began the walk back, the weight of their new reality pressing down on them with every step.
As they neared the familiar streets, a figure appeared in the distance. It was Bellatrix Wilkes, a classmate from school. The three girls exchanged brief, polite greetings, the kind that were customary but held no real meaning. Bellatrix, always observant, watched as Mari and Aurora continued on their way. But something nagged at her—a sense that something was off. The memory of their faces lingered in her mind, the tightness around their eyes, the hurried pace of their steps. There was a shadow of panic there, subtle but unmistakable. Bellatrix couldn’t shake the feeling that something was very wrong.
Mari arrived at the front of her house, her mind a whirlwind of confusion and fear. She hesitated, unsure of what to say to her mother. After a moment of deliberation, she decided it was safer to keep her silence. She couldn’t risk dragging her mother into the danger that loomed over her.
Stepping inside, Mari saw her mother, Mary Luzviminda, sitting on the couch, engrossed in a television show. But as soon as their eyes met, her mother’s expression shifted to one of concern.
Mary Luzviminda: “Is there a problem? You’re sweating a lot.”
Mari forced a smile, hoping it would ease her mother’s suspicions.
Mari: “No, Mom, there’s nothing wrong. I’m just exhausted from school.”
Mary Luzviminda studied her daughter for a moment, clearly unconvinced, but decided to let it go.
Mary Luzviminda: “I cooked some food. Make sure you eat,” she said, her tone gentle but firm.
Mari nodded, barely whispering a “yes” in response. She retreated to her room, needing a moment alone to collect her thoughts, to try and make sense of the chaos that had suddenly become her life.
During their conversation, they were unaware that Bellatrix Wilkes, one of Mari's classmates, was listening from a distance. Her curiosity was piqued by Mari’s revelation of her powers. Surprised and envious, Bellatrix decided to share this intriguing piece of information with Ian, one of the bullies in their class. She quickly made her way to where Ian was hanging out with his friends.
Bellatrix: “Ian, I need to tell you something.”
Ian looked up, interested.
Ian: “What is it?”
Bellatrix leaned in and whispered.
Bellatrix: “Come closer. I’ll tell you.”
Ian moved in, his eyes widening with surprise.
Ian: “Oh, is it true?” (His face broke into a grin.)
Bellatrix nodded, her excitement palpable. Ian's mind began racing, and he decided to involve his two companions, Emma and Victoria, in this new scheme. The three bullies gathered to discuss their plan.
Ian: “We should check out Mari and Aurora. Let’s see what trouble we can stir up.”
Victoria, who had a crush on Josh, blushed slightly but was intrigued by the idea.
Victoria: “Ah, well, that’s possible.”
Emma, known for her tough demeanor, added with a smirk.
Emma: “Forget the snacks; let’s just go. Victoria seems eager to treat us.”
Victoria: “Just enough with the cheap stuff, okay!!!” (She said this with a mix of annoyance and excitement.)
Ian: “Oh no! Come on, it’s such a waste. Let’s go, Josh. I’ve got something I want to tell you later.”
Josh, who had been nearby, looked puzzled.
Josh: “What is it?”
Ian: “I’ll explain in the canteen. Come on, or Victoria might just pee from excitement!” (Ian laughed.)
As they made their way to the canteen, Ian mulled over what he had overheard.
Ian: “I wonder why she has that?”
The canteen was bustling with noise as other students from different grades were on their recess. The four of them lined up to buy snacks.
Emma: “Victoria’s treating us, so just a biscuit and water for me.” (She smiled while looking for a place to sit.)
Victoria: “Oh yes.”
Ian: “Same for me. Thanks, Victoria.” (He grinned, knowing he didn’t have money for snacks.)
Victoria turned to Josh.
Victoria: “Josh, what about you?”
Josh: “Oh, I didn’t realize I’m already full because I ate a biscuit earlier.”
Victoria: “Oh, is that so?” (She responded with mild disappointment.)
Emma: “Oh, right. There’s an empty space over there.”
Ian: “Let’s go.”
Once they were seated, Ian brought up the topic again.
Ian: “Josh, are Mari and Aurora your friends?”
Josh: “Oh, why?”
Ian: “It’s nothing. I just overheard their conversation earlier on the school rooftop.”
Josh: “What were they talking about?”
Ian’s expression grew serious.
Ian: “I heard Mari say she has powers.”
Josh: “Huh? Where would she get that?”
Ian: “I don’t know.”
Josh: “Maybe it was just your imagination.”
Ian: “Maybe so. Victoria is taking so long to buy.”
A silent moment followed until Bellatrix had a sudden idea.
Ian: Josh! Josh: what! Ian: Aren't those two your best friends?
Josh: Oh, why?
Ian :Ask them about that; maybe they'll tell you too since you're best friends, right? I saw Victoria heading out with her purchases.
Victoria:Sorry for the delay, there are a lot of students buying. * Emma and Ian received their free snacks.*
 Emma: Thank you, Victoria!
 Ian:Thank you, Victoria! 
Victoria:You really!(galit na mukha nito) 
Ian: Hurry up and eat so we can go back to the room. * scene sa room*
Bellatrix:Why does she have powers?
The question lingered in the air as the group settled into their usual spots, each person absorbed in their own thoughts and plans, while the atmosphere buzzed with anticipation and curiosity.













Chapter 3: Chaos Theory

The girls dive into research, seeking to understand the origins and potential consequences of Mari’s powers. They spend late nights combing through old books, online forums, and talking to local elders. They uncover stories of others with similar abilities, but none as strong as Mari’s. They learn that these powers come at a cost—each change Mari makes to the future causes unintended side effects. The tension grows as Mari begins to doubt whether she should use her powers at all. The chapter highlights the growing urgency of their mission and the strain it places on their relationship.

Mari wakes up from a nap, utterly remembers what happened hours ago, grabs her phone, and calls her friend's number.

Sound: Ringing Phone

From the other line:
Aurora: “Why did you call Mari?”

Mari stands up,
Mari: “I just got more curious about this ability and what are the possible things I can do with this power. That’s why I called you so you can help me to find out more about this power.”
Mari said in a curious voice.

Aurora: “Okay, I’ll help you but first let me get my Laptop.”, Aurora responded.

Mari sat on her study table and opened her laptop,
Mari: “Sure, take your time.” Mari said to her friend.

The two start searching for the origin of the ability that Mari gained. As they browsed the internet they just got a pinch of information about what the power can do so they decided to go to the library in their locality. They gather the books that correlate with what Mari's power is and the two start reading but in the end, they just get a piece of information and they are not convinced that this is just the information they can gather for this ability to fully reveal its full potential until Aurora got information about a certain barrio in their locality, information about someone named Corason. As they search for Corason who is knowledgeable about the power they come to an old house with dead trees.

Mari: “Is this the right address?” Mari asked and Aurora just nodded with an expression of scared plastered in her face.

Aurora: “Are you sure we are going into that house?” Aurora asked with a shaky voice and grabbed Mari’s arm.

Mari: “I don’t have a choice and I want to fill my curiosity with why this power got onto me.” Mari said.

Aurora: “Okay, I’ll go with you but if anything happens use your power okay?”. Mari just nodded to what Aurora said.

The two entered the premises of the house of Corazon, and  the heavy feeling from the entrance of the location got more and more condense as they got to the front door of the house. Aurora got more clinging to Mari’s arm as they approached the door.

Aurora: “Can we get back?” Aurora asked Mari but the latter is persistent to know about the truth with her power.
Mari: “We are already here.” Mari smiled at Aurora to ease her worries.

Mari knocks on the wooden door but no one responds from the inside. Mari again knocks on the door but again the same answer is no one responds from the knocking. Until Mari feel a presence in their back and someone touches their shoulder.

Aurora: “AURORAAAAA!” Aurora shouts while clinging more to Mari’s arm.

Manang Corazon: “Who are you and what are you doing in my front door?” Manang Corazon asked the two ladies in front of her. She scanned the two from head to toe and when the moment she look into Mari’s eyes she knew what they came for.

Manang Corazon: “Come inside, I know what you two are looking for.” Manang Corazon said and she opened the wooden door. The two ladies behind her look at each other and they go inside the house. The saying, “Don’t judge the book by its cover” flustered Mari and Aurora's faces as they entered the house. From the outside, the house looks like it’s going to fall apart but when you enter the house you will be astonished by its elegance and beauty.

Mari and Aurora: “Wow! It’s beautiful!” Mari and Aurora said at the same time.

Manang Corazon: “Come here, lady…” Manang Corazon said while looking at Mari. Mari came forward, she reached the couch, and sat in the location where Corazon hand’s patted. “What is your name?” Corazon asked the fine lady in front of her. The lady smiled and tell her name.

Mari: “Mari Luzviminda.”

The old woman nods, her expression unreadable as she takes in Mari’s name. There’s a moment of silence, thick with anticipation, as Mari waits for Corazon to speak.
Manang Corazon: “You’ve come seeking answers about your power. I can see it in your eyes the confusion, the fear. But you must understand, this power you possess is not without its price.”
Mari’s heart races. She had expected to find answers, but the gravity in Corazon’s voice fills her with a new kind of dread.
Mari: “What do you mean, a price?”
Manang Corazon: “Every time you change the future, there are consequences. Some small, some... devastating. This power is not to be used lightly, for each ripple you create in time can turn into a storm.”
Aurora, who has been silently listening, finally speaks up, her voice trembling.
Aurora: “So, what should we do? How can Mari control it?”
Manang Corazon: “Control is an illusion. The best you can do is understand the weight of your actions and choose wisely. There are stories—people like you who tried to change their fate, only to bring about greater suffering. But... there are also tales of those who found a way to live with it, to bear the burden without breaking.”
Mari’s mind swirls with the implications of Corazon’s words. She had hoped for clear answers, a guide to mastering her abilities, but instead, she’s faced with more uncertainty.
Mari: “So, what should I do?”
Manang Corazon: “You must decide for yourself, child. The power is yours, and so is the responsibility. But remember, every choice you make echoes through time. Choose wisely, and you may find peace. Choose recklessly, and you may lose everything.”
The weight of Corazon’s words settles over Mari like a heavy blanket. She had sought understanding, and while she had gained some insight, she now realized that her journey was just beginning. The true challenge was not merely in using her power, but in navigating the moral and emotional labyrinth it created.
As they leave Corazon’s house, the air feels thick with the knowledge of what they have   learned. Mari and Aurora walk in silence, each lost in their thoughts. The world around them seems darker, more dangerous than before, as the realization sinks in: Mari’s power is both a gift and a curse, and how she uses it could change everything—for better or for worse.

Chapter 3.2: The Burden of Power
Her house, her mind still swirling with the weight of her new reality. She glanced back at Aurora, who gave her an encouraging nod before heading to her own home. Mari knew she couldn’t waste any time. She needed to understand her powers, and fast.
Mari’s House
Inside, Mari found her mother, Mary Luzviminda, sitting at the kitchen table, looking exhausted. The strain of raising Mari alone and the constant fear of the storms had taken its toll on her. Mari hesitated, not wanting to burden her mother with her newfound abilities, but she knew she couldn’t hide the truth forever.
Mary: “Mari, you look pale. Is everything alright?”
Mari forced a smile, trying to mask the fear coursing through her veins.
Mari: “Yeah, Mom. Just a lot on my mind. I’m going to my room for a bit.”
Mary watched her daughter disappear down the hallway, sensing that something was off but unsure of how to approach it. Mari’s room was her sanctuary, filled with memories, pictures of her friends, and mementos of simpler times. She sat on her bed, staring at her glowing hands, trying to grasp the magnitude of her powers. Her thoughts drifted back to her visions—the flooded city, the screams, the helplessness.
House of Aurora
Meanwhile, Aurora returned home, her mind still reeling from everything Mari had shown her. She knew they had to act fast, but she also knew that Mari needed a friend, someone to ground her amidst the chaos. Aurora gathered a few essentials, her thoughts lingering on Mari’s powers and the potential they held. She wasn’t just going to stand by, she was going to help Mari, no matter the cost.
City of Nectarville
Back in the city, the storm clouds that had once loomed ominously over Nectarville were gone, but the air remained tense, as if the city itself was holding its breath. Mari stood at her window, looking out at the streets that had once seemed so familiar but now felt foreign and threatening. The glowing in her hands flickered faintly, a reminder of the power she wielded and the heavy responsibility that came with it.
The Weight of Choices
Mari sat on the edge of her bed, the room’s silence pressing down on her like a heavy weight. The revelation from Corazon replayed in her mind – each ripple in time carried consequences she couldn’t predict. The gravity of it all was almost too much to bear.
Her gaze drifted to her glowing hands, a stark reminder of the power she now held and the responsibility that accompanied it. The idea that every choice she made could have far-reaching effects was both daunting and paralyzing. She could no longer see her life as it once was, simple and predictable. Now, every action, every decision seemed to carry a ripple effect she struggled to comprehend.
Mari’s phone buzzed on the nightstand, snapping her out of her thoughts. She picked it up with trembling fingers and dialed Aurora’s number. The line rang several times before Aurora’s voice, filled with concern, answered.
Aurora: “Her, Mari. Is everything okay?”
Mari: Her voice strained and quivering: “I need your help. I’ve been thinking about what Corazon said. I can’t just ignore this. I need to do something, but I don’t know where to start. Can we meet up?”
Aurora: “Of course,” Aurora replied immediately. “Let’s meet at the park. It’s quiet there, and we can think things through without any distractions.”
As she ended the call, Mari felt a flicker of relief at Aurora’s willingness to help. As she prepared to leave, her eyes wandered to the framed photos on her bedside table – snapshot of simpler times with friends and family. They felt like a lifetime ago now, a stark contrast to the turmoil she was experiencing.
She stepped out of the house, her thoughts racing. The street outside was quiet, bathed in the soft glow of the evening. As she walked towards the park, she glanced back at her home through the window near the front door. Her mother, Mary Luzviminda, was still sitting at the kitchen table, her posture slumped and her face etched with a deep, unspoken worry. Mari’s heart ached with the weight of the secret she was carrying. She wanted to protect her mother from the truth, but she also knew she couldn’t keep living this double life.
With a deep breath, Mari turned away and headed towards the park. Each step felt heavy, laden with the weight of the choices she had to make. The park was a few blocks away, a sanctuary of sorts amidst the chaos of her life. As she approached, she hoped that the quiet and the company of her friend might offer some clarity in this swirling storm of uncertainty.
Mari arrived at the park, the cool evening breeze brushing against her face as she took in the familiar surroundings. The park, with its gently rustling leaves and the soft glow of streetlights, offered a momentary reprieve from the chaos swirling within her. Aurora was already there, sitting on a bench and scanning the horizon, her expression a mixture of concern and anticipation.
Mari approached, and Aurora looked up, her eyes reflecting a blend of empathy and determination. Without a word, Mari sat beside her, and for a moment, they simply sat in silence, allowing the tranquility of the park to settle their nerves.
Mari: Her voice barely more than a whisper: “I don’t know where to start. The weight of everything is just too much.”
Aurora: Placing a reassuring hand on Mari’s shoulder: “We’ll figure this out together. But first, let’s focus on what you need to do now. It’s clear that Corazon’s warning wasn’t just a precaution; it’s something we need to take seriously.”
Mari nodded, her eyes fixed on the distant horizon.
Mari: Voice tinged with worry: “I feel like I have this power, but I’m still just a kid. I don’t know how to control it or understand its full scope. What if I make things worse?”
Aurora: Squeezing her shoulder gently: “The fact that you’re aware of the potential consequences shows that you’re already thinking wisely. We’ll take it one step at a time. We need to explore what you’re capable of and find a way to use it responsibly.”
As they talked, the reality of their situation began to sink in. Mari knew that her powers had the potential to change everything, but she was unprepared for the responsibility that came with them. The fear of unintended consequences weighed heavily on her, and the thought of her relationship with Aurora being tested by her own actions was a sobering realization.
Together, they watched as the sun set over the park, the darkness encroaching as the day gave way to night. The park, once a place of solace, now seemed to symbolize the uncertainty of their future. Mari and Aurora’s friendship, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos, was now intertwined with the very powers Mari struggled to control.
With a final, resolute look at the horizon, Mari stood up.
Mari: Determined: “We need to figure out how to use my powers without causing harm. If we don’t, we might end up making everything worse.”
Aurora: Nodding, standing beside her: “We will. We’ll face this challenge together, and we’ll make sure that whatever changes we make are for the better.”
As they walked away from the park, their silhouettes merging with the encroaching darkness, Mari felt a renewed sense of determination. She knew that the path ahead was fraught with danger and uncertainty, but with Aurora by her side, she was ready to confront whatever lay ahead.
The weight of her choices was immense, but Mari was prepared to face the consequences. Little did she know that her next steps would lead her into a whirlwind of altered realities and strained relationships, pushing her powers to the limit and testing the very fabric of her existence.






Chapter 4: Throwback Thursday

The park was bathed in the soft glow of twilight as Mari and Aurora decided to head home. As they walked, Mari couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss. She had a sense of foreboding, a premonition that something terrible was about to happen.
Aurora: “Are you okay, Mari?” (concerned look) noticing the troubled look on her face.
Mari: “I’m fine.” (smiles) trying to reassure her but deep down, she knew she wasn’t.
They exchanged goodbyes and parted ways. As Mari reached the bus stop, a familiar chill ran down her spine. She remembered the night of the typhoon as she realized the same thing might happen again soon. She knew she had to do something to prevent it, but she wasn’t sure what.
She hopped on the bus and went to her favorite area of the bus, at the back beside the window. Alone inside the bus, she thought of attempting to awaken her power, but to no avail, nothing happened. Thinking about her powers and trying to make an attempt to awaken them overwhelmed her, so she pulled out her headphones, hoping to distract herself from the intrusive thoughts that haunted her and started to drift off to sleep. But little did she know, the desperation to know about her powers and her constant thoughts of wanting to go back to the time of the typhoon led her to the place she truly desired, the nightmare she once experienced.
A wave of dizziness washed over her. When she opened her eyes, she found herself back on the night of the typhoon.
Mari: “I am back again on the day of the typhoon! I shouldn’t waste this time to modify the past once again.”
She rushed towards ESTIAI University, the floodwaters rising rapidly behind her. She had to save her friends, no matter the cost. The memory of their terrified faces, their desperate cries for help, was etched into her mind.
As she approached the university, the chaos was overwhelming. People were shouting, panic was setting in. Mari scanned the crowd, searching for her friends.
Mari: “I need to save my friends from drowning, I cannot afford to lose them again just like before.”
Aurora: “Mari! Over here! The water’s rising too fast! We’re trapped! Help us, please! We need to get out of here before it’s too late.”
Josh: “Mari, don’t give up on us! We’re stuck, and the water’s coming up so quickly. I don’t know how much longer we can stay here.”
Kurt: “Mari, hurry! The water’s getting higher, and it’s so cold. We’re losing our grip”
Mari: “Don’t give up! I’m here!” Her voice barely audible over the wind.
But even though she had arrived early, the storm's intensity was overwhelming. The floodwaters were rising faster than she could have imagined.
Mari: “Think, Mari, think! There has to be a way.”
Mari's mind raced. She knew she had to find a way to save her friends.
*Suddenly, the bus came to a stop and she woke up abruptly. She hurriedly got off the bus, and as she walked, she was thinking about the scenario that had just unfolded
(Sa isip ni Mari)
Mari: I need to tell this to Aurora.
(Sa Bahay nila)
Mary Luzviminda: Welcome back to our home, My child!
Mary Luzviminda: Have you eaten?
Mari: I'm not hungry yet.
Mary Luzviminda: Is that so? Alright, go ahead and change over there so we can eat.
(gulat na mukha ni Mari sabay kamot sa Ulo)
(at pumasok na si Mari sa kanyang kuwarto para mag palit)
Mary Luzviminda: Mari! What’s taking you so long to change? Hurry up or this I cooked will get cold.
Mari: Okay!
(pag kalabas nya ng kwarto)
Mary Luzviminda: Oh, sit down there and eat. Please turn on the TV; it’s been raining a lot, there might be a storm.
(kinuha ang remote ng tv tsaka ito binuksan)
(pagbukas ng tv agad lumabas ang news report)
Mary Luzviminda: Oh, there's a typhoon coming our way this week.Do you always bring your umbrella?
Mari: Yes.
(pag tapos nila kumain)
Mary Luzviminda:Oh, alright, I'll wash the dishes.
Mari: Thank you, mom.
Mary Luzviminda: Are you going to school tomorrow? Are you going to bring lunch?
Mari: Yes mom!
Mary Luzviminda: Goodnight
Mari : Goodnight mom





Chapter 5: Revelations/Exodus
FIRST ENDING
The final chapter brings everything full circle. Mari and Aurora find themselves back on the rooftop of the STI building as the super typhoon hits. Despite all their efforts, they couldn’t stop the storm. From the rooftop, they witness the city below them, devastated by the floodwaters.


SECOND ENDING
  They have one final choice to make—use Mari’s powers to undo everything, sacrificing their relationship and memories, or let events play out, knowing they did everything they could to save as many lives as possible. In the end, they choose to accept the consequences of their actions, embracing each other as the storm rages around them.
