TO UNDERSTAND THE STORY READ THE WHOLE PLOT:
August 24, 2024 - Mari Luzviminda, a 17-year-old girl from the Philippines, wakes in the middle of a violent super typhoon. The wind howls like a living thing, and the rain lashes against her window with a force that makes the glass rattle. The house around her groans as if struggling to stay together. Confused and frightened, Mari stumbles out of bed, her heart pounding as she tries to make sense of the chaos.
Mari: "Oh no, what's happening? It feels like this storm will kill us all. The wind is howling so loud, and the house is shaking. I can’t believe how strong the rain is hitting the window. I have to get out of here!"
The storm outside is unlike anything she’s ever seen. The world beyond her window is a blur of water and wind, and she can barely make out the shapes of buildings and trees bending under the force of the typhoon. She tries to reach for her phone, but there’s no signal, no way to call for help. A deep sense of dread settles in her stomach.
Mari: "I can’t see anything outside. It’s all just a blur of water and wind. I can't even reach my phone—there’s no signal. This dread... it's suffocating. I don’t know what to do. How can I call for help?"
As she stands frozen, trying to figure out what to do, something strange happens. Her vision blurs, and suddenly she’s overwhelmed by a vivid image—a vision that feels too real to be just a figment of her imagination. She sees herself standing on the rooftop of the ESTIAI University, the tallest structure in her city, which is now known as ESTIAI University.
Mari: "What is this? My vision is blurring, and now I’m on the rooftop of the STI building. Is this a dream? The city is completely submerged. How could this happen?"
From this high vantage point, she looks out over the city of Dasmariñas, and what she sees makes her blood run cold.
Mari: "This is awful. The city is underwater, and there’s so much debris. People are drowning, clinging to rooftops, and being swept away. The sound of the storm is drowning out everything. It’s all so devastating."
The entire city is submerged under floodwaters. Streets she once knew are now rivers, churning with debris—cars, broken furniture, and uprooted trees. The water is everywhere, drowning everything in its path. Mari can hear the distant cries of people, their voices muffled by the roar of the storm. Some are clinging to rooftops, others are being swept away by the relentless current. The scene is one of utter devastation.
Mari: "I’m back in my room, but that vision... it felt so real. My hands are glowing, but I don’t understand why. I can’t stay here; I have to get to the ESTIAI University building. It might be my only chance."
The vision is so intense, so real, that it leaves Mari gasping for breath when it finally fades. She’s back in her bedroom at her house, but the memory of the flooded city lingers in her mind, too vivid to ignore. She looks down at her hands, and to her shock, they’re glowing with a soft, eerie light. She doesn’t understand what’s happening, but she knows one thing—she can’t stay here.
Mari: "If the city is going to flood like in my vision, the ESTIAI University building might be the only place high enough to stay safe. I need to get out of here."
The memory of the ESTIAI University building, standing tall above the floodwaters, pulls her into action. If the city is going to flood like in her vision, the ESTIAI University building might be the only place high enough to stay safe. She rushes out of her house, into the storm, the glow in her hands pulsing as if guiding her through the chaos.
Mari: "The streets are turning into rivers. The rain is relentless. People are shouting, and the water is rising too quickly. I have to get through this chaos and make it to the university. I have to survive."
Outside, the world is already falling apart. The streets are turning into rivers, the rain coming down so hard it feels like it might tear through her skin. She can hear the cries of her neighbors, the panicked shouts of people trying to escape. But the water is rising fast, faster than anyone can react.
Mari: "Everything around me is destroyed—cars are half-submerged, power lines are sparking, and trees are uprooted. This place is a nightmare. I need to get to my friends, but the storm is making it impossible."
As Mari fights her way through the storm, she sees signs of destruction everywhere—cars are half-submerged, their headlights flickering weakly in the water; power lines are down, sparking dangerously; trees have been torn from the ground, their roots exposed like broken limbs. The world around her is a nightmare come to life.
Aurora: “Mari! Over here! The water’s rising too fast! We’re trapped! Help us, please! We need to get out of here before it’s too late.”
Josh: “Mari, don’t give up on us! We’re stuck, and the water’s coming up so quickly. I don’t know how much longer we can stay here.”
Kurt: “Mari, hurry! The water’s getting higher, and it’s so cold. We’re losing our grip.”
Mari: "There they are—Aurora, Josh, and Kurt. They’re trapped, and I can’t reach them. The water’s too strong. Oh no, I see it again—the vision of them being swept away. I can’t let this happen."
She turns a corner and spots a group of her closest friends—Aurora Averill, Josh Majica, and Kurt Hendrix. Relief floods through her, but it’s short-lived. They’re trapped, the water already up to their waists, and the current is too strong for them to move. Mari tries to reach them, but the force of the water is overwhelming, pushing her back.
________________________________________
Mari: "The vision is happening again. The water is rising, and they’re being dragged under. Their screams... I can hear them. I can’t save them. Time is rewinding, but it’s all playing out the same. Why can’t I change anything?"
Panic surges through her, and then, without warning, she has another vision. She sees the water surge even higher, sweeping her friends off their feet, dragging them under. Their screams for help are cut short as they disappear beneath the surface, swallowed by the flood. The vision is so real, so immediate, that it leaves Mari reeling.
Mari: "I failed. I saw the flood; I tried, but it wasn’t enough (sobbing). My friends are gone. I’m left here with nothing but this power that couldn’t help. I have to keep moving. I have to reach the university."
She loses hope all of her friends as they drown in the abyss of the Flood, as she tries to reach the top of the University the glow in her hands intensifies. Instinctively, she raises her hand, willing herself to do something, anything, to save them. The world around her shudders, and suddenly, time rewinds. The water recedes slightly, and she’s back to a moment before the surge. But even with this second chance, she can’t reach them in time. The scene plays out exactly as she saw it—her friends are swept away, their bodies disappearing into the dark, swirling water.
Mari: "Finally, I’m at the university. The entrance is underwater, but I have to push through. I have to climb. I can’t stop now. I need to get to the rooftop. I need to see if my vision was true."
Mari collapses to her knees, the glow in her hands fading as exhaustion and grief wash over her. The power to rewind time was real, but it wasn’t enough. Her friends are gone, lost to the storm, and she’s left alone in the rising water, their final screams echoing in her mind.
Mari: "I’m on the rooftop. The city is completely submerged. My friends are gone, my home is destroyed. This thing in my hand... What am I going to do now?"
Desperate and broken, Mari forces herself to her feet. She has to keep moving, has to survive, if only to make sense of what’s happening to her. The vision of the ESTIAI University building, still standing above the flood, drives her forward. She stumbles through the water, each step harder than the last, as the storm continues to batter the city.
She finally reaches the top of the building; she sees all of the houses and people washed away by the flood, and she is the only survivor.
Mari: "What is the reason why you giving me this vision??" (crying as she remembers how her friends die drowning)

DETAILED SCRIPT:
AUGUST 14,2024 
( A week before it happens)
Exhausted, grief-stricken, and confused, Mari’s world fades to black as she loses consciousness.
When Mari awakens, she’s no longer on the rooftop. She’s back. she wakes up in the classroom where she sees her classmates and friends, she cant believe what she dream
Mari: "Where am I? Back in the classroom? It felt so real—was it just a dream or a mere Nightmare? a dream in another dream (confuse) but My hands still glow. I can’t stay here. I need answers. I need to figure out what’s happening to me."
She looks down at her hands, half-expecting the glow to be gone, but it’s still there, faint but undeniable. Panic sets in. She can’t stay here, not like this, not knowing what’s happening to her. Ignoring the curious glances of her classmates, including Victoria Viotto, Ian Trongcoso, Emma Pierce, and Dylan Piece, who are usually quick to bully her, Mari bolts from the room, her mind reeling with the memories of the storm, the loss of her friends, and the terrifying power she doesn’t understand.
———-
Decisions 1
She will go outside the Classroom (if she goes out of the classroom the decision 1 Aurora would start)
Decisions 2
She will not go Outside of the Classroom (if she doesn't go out of the classroom, Josh Decisions 2 will go)

Mari: "I’m leaving. My classmates are staring, and I can’t explain this. I don’t understand what’s going on with me. I have to find out. I have to get out of here and find some answers."
Larry Villarreal, her professor, watches in confusion as she flees, not knowing what to do. 
Larry Villarreal watched in confusion as Mari Luzviminda bolted from the classroom. His brow furrowed in concern.
Larry Villarreal: “What just happened? Why did she run out like that? Is everything alright?”
With a worried glance around the room, Larry began to gather his thoughts. Meanwhile, Mari raced down the hallway, her heart pounding with a mix of fear and determination. The strange butterfly was still fluttering ahead of her, guiding her through the chaos in her mind.

DECISION 1 (Aurora’s Path to Mari)
Mari: “I need to follow  this butterfly. Maybe it’s leading me to something important.”(decision1) 
She followed the butterfly to the nearest restroom. The faint glow in her hands flickered in the dim light. As she entered, she noticed the faucet over the sink. She turned it on, letting the water flow freely, creating a gentle but growing flood on the bathroom floor. The sound of the running water seemed to calm her racing thoughts, though the rising water was beginning to worry her.
Mari watched as the water pooled around her feet, rising steadily. The butterfly landed delicately on her wrist, its wings fluttering softly. Mari stared in awe as the insect seemed to settle there, and with a sudden, inexplicable sensation, a small blue butterfly tattoo appeared on her wrist, exactly resembling the one that had guided her.
Mari: “What is this? Why is this happening to me?”
Before she could fully grasp the significance of the tattoo, the restroom door swung open. Aurora Averill, running late, burst in, her eyes widening in shock as she saw the flooded restroom.
Aurora: “Mari, what’s going on? The water—” (decision 1)
Aurora’s foot slipped on the wet floor, and she lost her balance. She fell hard, hitting her head against the tile with a sickening thud. The impact was brutal, and Aurora lay unconscious, her body still and unmoving amidst the rising water.
Mari’s eyes widened in horror as she witnessed the scene. The reality of Aurora’s death, the same death she had feared, hit her with a wave of helplessness.
Mari: “No! Not again! I have to do something!”
In a panic, she raised her hands, the glowing light intensifying as she desperately wished to undo the tragedy. The world around her shimmered, and time began to rewind. The water receded, the butterfly vanished from her wrist, and Aurora’s body was lifted from the floor as if being pulled backward in time.
Mari: “I can’t believe it’s happening again. Is this power really going to save her?”
Before Mari could fully comprehend the situation, she found herself back in the classroom, sitting at her desk. The clock ticked away, and everything seemed to have returned to normal. Aurora, along with her other classmates, was present, chatting and laughing as if nothing had happened. Mari looked down at her hands, no longer glowing, and saw that the tattoo had disappeared.
Mari: “Am I back in the classroom? Was it all just a dream? Did I really go back in time?”
Confused and exhausted, Mari looked around the classroom, trying to piece together the fragments of her fragmented memories. The class continued as if nothing unusual had occurred. Mari’s heart raced with the realization that she had somehow rewound time again, but the exact nature of her powers remained a mystery.
She took a deep breath, struggling to steady her nerves. With a determined resolve, she knew she had to understand her abilities and what had led her to this point. She needed answers, and she couldn’t waste any more time.
Mari: “I need to find out what’s happening to me. I have to understand this power and what it means.”
Determined to uncover the truth, Mari stood up from her desk, her mind racing with the possibilities of what lay ahead. The classroom seemed oddly normal, but Mari was far from reassured. She had experienced a devastating glimpse into the future and managed to alter it, but the mystery of her powers was only beginning to unfold.
As Mari left the classroom, she knew her journey was far from over. She had to delve deeper into the enigma of her abilities and uncover the truth behind the visions and the strange, glowing power she possessed. The path ahead was uncertain, but Mari was ready to face whatever challenges awaited her.
 
DECISION 2: JOSH PATH TO MARI
Context: (She will see the butterfly but she will not mind it, then if she doesn't go to the comfort room or restroom aurora will not see her and later on die): and josh will ask her whats wrong (Josh path), she will flee the room to go home but along the way she will see the butterfly again and that's the time the butterfly will unified with her, she will lost consciousness and when she wakes up she is in her room and her mom will said that Josh brought her home cause he sees her lying on the street, going home)
The chapter ends with Mari fleeing the school, desperate for answers, and terrified of what she might discover.
SCRIPT
Mari’s head spins as she sits in the classroom, heart pounding, her hands faintly glowing. The classroom is alive with chatter, but all she can think of is the vision—the storm, the loss, the glow.

Mari (internally):
"That vision… What’s happening to me? My hands are still glowing. I need answers. I need to figure out what’s going on, but I can’t focus here."

A butterfly flutters into her field of vision, just like before. But this time, she hesitates, eyes lingering on it.

Mari (internally):
"No… I won’t follow it this time. I need to keep my head clear."

Instead of leaving, she stays at her desk, gripping its edges as the butterfly flits past her. She watches it disappear down the hall but forces herself to stay put.

Josh Reyes, who sits a few seats away, notices Mari’s tension. Concerned, he walks over and kneels beside her desk.

Josh:
“Mari, are you okay? You look like you’ve seen a ghost. What’s going on?”

Mari (anxious, trying to dismiss him):
“Nothing, Josh. I’m fine, I just… need a moment.”

Josh (persistent):
“Come on, Mari. I know when something’s wrong. You’re shaking. You don’t have to pretend.”

Mari tries to brush him off, but Josh isn’t budging. She glances at him, her breath catching as flashes of her vision return—the storm, the destruction, Aurora’s death.

Mari (softly, overwhelmed):
“I don’t understand it, Josh. Something’s wrong with me… I keep seeing things that haven’t happened yet… but they feel so real. And… my hands…”

She looks down at her hands, the glow now fading. Josh’s eyes widen in confusion but also concern.
OUTSIDE. SCHOOL GROUNDS – DAY

Mari bursts through the school doors and sprints out onto the street. Her breath comes in short gasps as she runs. She doesn’t know where she’s going—only that she needs to escape.

As she turns a corner, the world blurs around her. She feels the pressure building inside, a mix of fear and exhaustion. Her mind flashes back to the vision of the storm, her friends' faces, and the glow of her hands.

Mari (internally, panicking):
"What is happening to me? Why can’t I stop seeing it? I need to… just breathe."

She slows down, her breath shaky. As she continues walking home, a familiar flicker of movement catches her eye.

The butterfly—the same one she ignored earlier—reappears, its wings shimmering in the evening light. It hovers in front of her, as if waiting for her to follow.

Mari (internally, confused):
"You again… but why? What do you want from me?"

This time, she can’t resist. She reaches out to it, and the butterfly flutters closer, landing gently on her arm. Her skin tingles as it crawls onto her wrist. Before she can react, the butterfly dissolves into her skin, sending a wave of dizziness through her body.

Mari (fading out):
“No… not again…”

The world spins, and her legs buckle beneath her. She collapses onto the sidewalk, the last thing she sees being the butterfly’s glow fading as everything goes black.


IN. MARI’S BEDROOM – NIGHT

Mari awakens in her bed, the faint glow of the evening sun casting soft shadows across her room. Her head feels heavy, but the first thing she notices is the absence of the glowing hands. She’s safe. She’s home.

Before she can process how she got there, her mother walks in, a worried look on her face.

Mari’s Mom (relieved):
“Mari, you’re awake! I was so worried.”

Mari (groggy, confused):
“Mom… how did I get here? I was… on the street…”

Mari’s Mom (sitting beside her):
“Josh brought you home. He found you unconscious on the way and carried you all the way here. He said you fainted.”

Mari blinks, trying to remember. The last thing she recalls is the butterfly and then… nothing.

Mari (quietly, to herself):
“Josh… he brought me home…”

Her mother brushes a strand of hair from Mari’s face, concern still lingering in her eyes.

Mari’s Mom (gently):
“Do you want to talk about what happened? You scared me, Mari.”

Mari (shaking her head, still processing):
“I don’t know, Mom. I just… I need to figure it out.”

Her mother nods, giving her a comforting pat on the hand.

Mari’s Mom (softly):
“Alright, sweetie. Just rest for now. We can talk later.”

As her mother leaves the room, Mari lies back on the pillow, staring at the ceiling. Her mind races with questions about the butterfly, her powers, and why everything feels so strange. She glances down at her wrist, half-expecting the butterfly tattoo to reappear, but there’s nothing.

Mari (determined, quietly):
“I need answers. I can’t keep running.”

She closes her eyes, exhaustion pulling her into sleep once more. But this time, she knows her journey for the truth has only just begun.







Chapter 2: The Unveiling







Mari Luzviminda sat on the edge of her bed, her heart still racing from the harrowing events of the storm. The violent super typhoon had forced her to confront a terrifying vision of her friends drowning, a scene that replayed in her mind like a haunting echo. She pulled out her phone, hesitating for a moment before typing a message to Aurora Averill.
Mari: Hey, Aurora. Can you meet me at the warehouse after class? I need to show you something important.
After hitting send, she stared at the screen, anxiety gnawing at her. Would Aurora believe her? Would she understand the weight of the power that had been thrust upon Mari? Moments later, her phone buzzed with a reply.
Aurora: Of course! Is everything okay?
Mari: Not really, but I’ll explain everything when I see you.
With a deep breath, Mari steeled herself for what lay ahead. The power she possessed was still new and terrifying, but she knew she could trust Aurora.
As the school day dragged on, Mari found it hard to concentrate. Every sound seemed amplified—the chatter of students, the ringing of the bell, the rustling of papers. She was preoccupied with thoughts of what she was about to reveal. Would Aurora still see her as the same person, or would the revelation of her abilities change everything between them?
Finally, the final bell rang, and Mari rushed out of the classroom. She spotted Aurora waiting for her near the entrance, a concerned expression on her face.
Aurora: “Hey! You look like you’ve seen a ghost. What’s going on?”
Mari took a deep breath, glancing around to make sure no one was listening. “Let’s just go to the warehouse. It’s… better if we talk there.”
As they walked, Aurora filled the silence with light-hearted chatter.
Aurora: “I hope you’re not going to tell me you’ve joined a secret society or something.”
Mari chuckled softly, appreciating Aurora’s attempt to lighten the mood. “No secret societies, I promise. Just a big secret about me.”
When they reached the warehouse, the familiar creaking door and dim light felt oddly comforting. Mari could see the shadows of their past conversations dancing in the corners, a reminder of how far they had come.
Mari: “This place used to be our safe haven. It feels different now, doesn’t it?”
Aurora nodded, a serious expression crossing her face. “Yeah, it feels… heavier. What’s going on, Mari?”
Mari took a step back, gathering her thoughts. “I have powers. I can see glimpses of the future and rewind time.”
Aurora’s brow furrowed in disbelief.
Aurora: “What? You’re serious?”
With a wave of her hand, Mari focused on a small stone on the floor, lifting it briefly into the air. It hovered for a moment before settling back down.
Aurora gasped, her eyes widening.
Aurora: “That’s incredible! But… how does it work?”
Mari took a deep breath, explaining her powers in more detail. She demonstrated how she could rewind time by picking up a plant and dropping it, then reversing it back to its original state.
Aurora was silent for a moment, her mind racing.
Aurora: “So, you can actually go back and change events? But that sounds… dangerous.”
Mari nodded, her expression turning serious.
Mari: “It is. I tried to save my friends during the flood, but I couldn’t change everything. I need to figure out how to control this power.”
Aurora stepped closer, her voice gentle.
Aurora: “You don’t have to carry this alone, Mari. We can work on this together.”
The weight of Aurora’s words settled over them like a warm blanket. Mari felt the tension in her chest ease slightly.
Mari: “Thank you. It means a lot to me. I don’t know what I’d do without you.”
As they sat together in the warehouse, the atmosphere shifted from one of fear to determination. They shared their hopes and worries, plotting how to navigate the complexities of Mari’s newfound abilities.
Aurora: “You have this power for a reason, and together, we can figure out how to use it. We’re stronger as a team, right?”
Mari smiled, feeling a flicker of hope amidst the chaos.
Mari: “Yeah, together.”
The two friends sat in silence for a moment, the enormity of their task ahead hanging in the air. In that quiet sanctuary, they felt a renewed sense of purpose, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.

If Mari Sends the Message
After hitting send, Mari stared at the screen, anxiety gnawing at her. Would Aurora believe her? Would she understand the weight of the power that had been thrust upon Mari? Moments later, her phone buzzed with a reply.
Aurora: Of course! Is everything okay?
Mari: Not really, but I’ll explain everything when I see you.
With a deep breath, Mari steeled herself for what lay ahead. The power she possessed was still new and terrifying, but Aurora was the only person she trusted.
________________________________________
If Mari Deletes the Message
Mari sighed and deleted the message, locking her phone. “This is my problem,” she muttered to herself. “I can’t put this on her.” Her heart sank at the thought of shouldering this burden alone, but she told herself it was the right thing to do.
________________________________________
At School
The school day dragged on, Mari’s mind clouded by visions of the typhoon and thoughts of what lay ahead. She spotted Aurora near the school entrance after the final bell.
If Mari Sent the Message
Aurora was waiting, concern etched on her face.
Aurora: “Hey! You look like you’ve seen a ghost. What’s going on?”
Mari glanced around nervously.
Mari: “Let’s just go to the warehouse. It’s better if we talk there.”
Aurora raised an eyebrow but didn’t press.
Aurora: “Alright, lead the way.”
If Mari Deleted the Message
Aurora waved with a bright smile.
Aurora: “Hey! You look exhausted. Are you okay?”
Mari forced a smile.
Mari: “Just tired. The storm shook me up.”
Aurora frowned.
Aurora: “Do you want to hang out later? I feel like I haven’t seen you in forever.”
Mari hesitated:
1.	Agree to spend time with Aurora. Pretend everything is fine and enjoy her company, even if only for a little while.
2.	Make an excuse and head to the warehouse alone. Focus on testing her abilities without distractions.
________________________________________
The Warehouse
The familiar creak of the warehouse door greeted Mari as she entered. Alone in the dim light, she felt the weight of her decisions. The empty space echoed with memories of her and Aurora’s past conversations, but today it felt different—heavier.
If Aurora Came Along
Aurora glanced around, her expression serious.
Aurora: “So, what’s this big secret? Did you join a secret society or something?”
Mari chuckled softly despite her nerves.
Mari: “No secret societies. It’s… about me. I have powers.”
Aurora blinked.
Aurora: “Wait—what?”
Mari hesitated:
1.	Demonstrate her powers immediately. Levitate a small object as proof.
2.	Explain her visions first. Help Aurora understand the stakes before showing her abilities.
________________________________________
If Mari Demonstrates Immediately
Mari waved her hand, lifting a small stone into the air. It hovered for a moment before settling back down.
Aurora: “That’s incredible! How does it work?”
Mari explained how she could see glimpses of the future and rewind time, then demonstrated by dropping a plant and reversing its fall.
Aurora’s awe turned to concern.
Aurora: “You can actually change events? That sounds… dangerous.”
Mari nodded.
Mari: “It is. I tried to save my friends during the flood, but I couldn’t change everything. I need to figure out how to control this.”
Aurora stepped closer.
Aurora: “You don’t have to carry this alone. We’ll figure it out together.”
________________________________________
If Mari Explains Visions First
Mari explained how she had witnessed the flood and how she struggled to save her friends. Then, she demonstrated by reversing a falling plant.
Aurora: “I can’t believe it… but this is real, isn’t it? This… it could be dangerous, but also incredible.”
Mari nodded, determination in her voice.
Mari: “I need to figure out how to control it. I need to be able to change the future—without it breaking everything.”
Aurora stepped closer.
Aurora: “We’ll figure it out. Together.”
________________________________________
If Mari Came Alone
The silence of the warehouse felt oppressive. Mari sat cross-legged on the floor, concentrating on a small stone. She lifted it into the air with a wave of her hand, but her control wavered, and the stone fell with a thud.
The strain of using her powers triggered something within her. The warehouse blurred, and suddenly she was back in the storm. Rain lashed her skin, and her friends’ cries cut through the wind. She tried to rewind the vision, but no matter how hard she fought, the outcome stayed the same.
Gasping, she collapsed on the floor, tears stinging her eyes. Her powers had limits. She couldn’t save everyone—but what could she change? Could she trust herself to try?
________________________________________
A Crossroads
After the storm of emotions, Mari was faced with another choice:
1.	Reach out to Aurora after all. Admit she couldn’t handle this alone.
2.	Continue practicing alone. Dedicate herself to mastering her powers, no matter the cost.
________________________________________
If Mari Reaches Out to Aurora
The next morning, Aurora cornered Mari at school, concern etched on her face.
Aurora: “Mari, something’s wrong. You’ve been distant, and I know you better than that. What’s going on?”
Mari hesitated before confessing everything—her powers, the vision of the typhoon, and the guilt of not being able to save her friends. Aurora listened, her expression shifting between disbelief and determination.
Aurora: “You have this power for a reason. Whatever’s ahead, we’re stronger as a team, right?”
Mari felt a flicker of hope.
Mari: “Yeah. Together.”
________________________________________
If Mari Keeps Practicing Alone
Mari stayed in the warehouse late into the night, testing the edges of her abilities. Each attempt left her more drained than the last. The isolation gnawed at her, and doubts crept in.
Was she protecting Aurora, or was she making things harder for herself?





CHAPTER 2.2 THE STIRRING






Aurora turned to Mari, her brow furrowed with concern. “We need to understand your powers. If you can see the future and rewind time, there has to be a way to use that to make things better. But first, let’s get back to our houses. We need to grab a change of clothes and anything else we might need before we dive into this.”
Mari nodded, the weight of their new reality pressing down on her with every step they took back toward their neighborhood. Her thoughts were too tangled to form words, but Aurora’s presence provided a sense of comfort amid the chaos.
The vision left Mari rattled, but it also brought a sense of urgency. She needed to act, and fast. Her mind raced as she weighed her
Mari choice:
1.Tell Josh About Powers: he could trust them. They’d proven that time and again. But telling them meant dragging them into danger.
2. Face it alone: She could try to figure out her powers on her own, sparing her friends the risks. But could she handle it
________________________________________
IF Tell Josh About Powers:
The light of the living room made the shadows seem alive as Mari sat across from Josh. Her hands gripped the edges of the couch, knuckles white as she tried to gather her thoughts. Josh, ever patient, waited in silence, his sharp hazel eyes fixed on her with quiet intensity.
Mari: Josh I need to tell you something It’s about me.
Josh: Whatever it is, you can tell me. I promise.
Mari: I can see the future, And when something goes wrong, I can rewind time.
Josh: You’re serious,
________________________________________

IF Face it alone:
As Mari reached their neighborhood, Mari’s mind was spinning. The weight of her powers—of seeing the future and rewinding time—pressed heavily on her. She felt like a ticking bomb, unsure of when she might spiral out of control.
Josh: Hey, you okay? I’m here if you need me.
Mari:I’m fine, Josh. Just school stuff. I’m going to my room

To School:
The morning air was crisp as Mari trudged down the street toward the bus stop. Her bag felt heavier than usual, not because of the books inside, but because of the weight of her secret. The visions she’d seen—flashes of chaos, danger, and uncertainty—had kept her up all night.
As she approached the stop, she saw Josh waiting there, his headphones on, bobbing his head to an invisible beat. He spotted her and waved, his usual goofy grin lighting up his face.
IF Tell Josh About Powers
Josh: Morning, Mari! Ready for another exciting day of educational torture?
Mari: Josh, can we talk? Like, really talk?
Josh: Uh-oh. This sounds serious. What’s up?"
Mari: It’s not easy to explain,” she began, her voice low. “But you’re my best friend, and you deserve to know.
Josh: brow furrowed. “Know what?
Mari: took a deep breath, steadying herself. “I have. powers. I can see the future and rewind time.”
IF Face it alone
Josh: Morning, Mari! You look like you fought a tornado and lost,
Mari: Rough night
Josh: You okay? You’ve been acting. different lately.
Mari: I’m fine, Just school stress, you know.
Mari House:
Josh approached Mari’s house. He hesitated at the gate, adjusting the straps on his backpack. Mari had seemed off at school earlier, and after their conversation about her powers, he felt compelled to check on her. Taking a deep breath, he pushed the gate open and walked up to the door.
Mari opened it almost immediately, as if she had been expecting him. Her face lit up with relief when she saw him.
Mari: “Josh! What are you doing here?” she asked, stepping aside to let him in.
Josh:  “I wanted to see how you’re holding up You’ve been through a lot
Mari: “Thanks. It’s been...a lot to process. But I’m glad you’re here.”

If Josh Helps Mari Control Her Powers:
Mari met Josh and Aurora in the park near their neighborhood. The tension of the past few days hung heavy in the air, but Josh’s calm determination brought a measure of comfort to Mari’s frazzled nerves
Josh: Mari, if we’re going to deal with people like Bellatrix and Ian, you need to have better control over your powers. We can’t risk them figuring out how to exploit you.
Mari: I don’t know if I can. Every time I use my powers, it feels like... like I’m walking a tightrope. If I mess up, I could make things worse.
________________________________________

IF Mari’s Decision to Face Her Powers
Mari stood in the quiet of her room, staring at the chaos of her own thoughts, she felt an overwhelming pressure. Her mind raced between the strange, new abilities she had discovered and the constant fear of what might happen if she couldn’t control them. The weight of her powers seemed heavier than any responsibility she had ever faced, and it terrified her to think about what they could mean.
Josh voice echoed in her mind: “If you can see the future and rewind time, there has to be a way to use that to make things better.” But Mari wasn’t sure she could. She had tried to change the past And She Dizzy
Josh: Mari? Josh voice came from the other side. “Are you okay?”
Mari swallowed hard and forced a small smile, though it didn’t reach her eyes. “Yeah, I’m fine. Just thinking.”
	







Chapter 3: Chaos Theory













(aurora path)
A sudden burst of energy jolted Mari awake from a restless nap. Her thoughts were a jumble of curiosity and fear about her abilities. Grabbing her phone, she dialed Aurora’s number, her heart pounding in anticipation.
Sound: Ringing Phone
**From the other line:**
Aurora: “Why did you call, Mari?”
Mari stood up, her voice brimming with urgency.
Mari: “I just got more curious about this ability and what I can do with it. That’s why I called—you can help me find out more about this power.”
Aurora: “Okay, I’ll help you, but first let me get my laptop.”
Mari: “Sure, take your time.”
As Aurora gathered her things, Mari opened her own laptop, and they began their search for answers. They scoured online forums, old books, and obscure articles, but the information was scant and unsatisfying. Determined to uncover the truth, they decided to visit the local library, hoping to find something that could shed light on Mari’s unique powers.
After hours of sifting through dusty tomes and obscure texts, they stumbled upon a mention of a woman named Corazon, known for her knowledge of strange abilities. The mention ignited a flicker of hope in Mari’s heart.
Mari: “Could this be the breakthrough we need?”
Aurora: “Let’s find out. This might lead us to the answers.”
They followed the address from the book, navigating through streets lined with dead trees, an unsettling atmosphere growing heavier with each step. Little did they know, they were being followed by Bellatrix Wilkes, who was intrigued and determined to uncover their secret.
Bellatrix: “What are these two doing here?” she muttered to herself as she trailed them, plotting her next move.
Finally, they arrived at an old, dilapidated house. Aurora looked up, fear etched across her features.
Aurora: “Are you sure we’re going in there?”
Mari: “I have to know why this power came to me.”
With Aurora clinging to her arm, they approached the creaking front door. Mari knocked, but silence lingered heavily in the air. After a few moments, the door opened, revealing an elderly woman with piercing eyes.
Manang Corazon: “Come in, then. Let’s talk.”
The house’s exterior had looked ready to collapse, but stepping inside, they were astonished by its hidden elegance.
Mari and Aurora: “Wow! It’s beautiful!”
As they settled on a couch, Corazon studied them, her gaze landing on Mari.
Manang Corazon: “You’ve come seeking answers about your power.”
Mari felt her heart race.
Mari: “What do you mean, a price?”
Corazon’s eyes darkened, conveying the weight of her words.
Manang Corazon: “Every time you change the future, there are consequences. Some small, some… devastating. This power is not to be used lightly, for each ripple you create in time can turn into a storm.”
Aurora, trembling, finally spoke up.
Aurora: “So, what should we do? How can Mari control it?”
Manang Corazon: “Control is an illusion. The best you can do is understand the weight of your actions and choose wisely. There are stories of others who tried to change their fate, only to bring about greater suffering. But… there are also tales of those who found a way to bear the burden without breaking.”
Mari’s mind swirled with uncertainty.
Mari: “So, what should I do?”
Manang Corazon: “You must decide for yourself, child. The power is yours, and so is the responsibility. But remember, every choice you make echoes through time. Choose wisely, and you may find peace. Choose recklessly, and you may lose everything.”
As they left Corazon’s house, the weight of her words settled over Mari and Aurora like a heavy blanket. The world outside felt darker and more dangerous than before. They walked in silence, each lost in thought, grappling with the knowledge that Mari’s power was both a gift and a curse.
The realization hit them: how Mari used her power could change everything—for better or for worse. Unbeknownst to them, Bellatrix was already plotting to exploit this knowledge, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.
As Mari and Aurora delved deeper into the mysteries of Mari's abilities, their initial excitement began to fray at the edges. The late nights spent in research transformed into anxious days as they uncovered the chilling implications of what Mari could do. Each new piece of information revealed not just the potential of her powers but the heavy costs associated with them. Mari felt the pull of her abilities grow stronger, yet with it came an overwhelming sense of dread.
The tension escalated as Mari grappled with the reality that every alteration she could make rippled outward, causing unforeseen consequences. The girls’ bond was tested under the pressure of their mission, as Mari started to question whether her powers were truly a gift or a curse. With every flicker of light from her hands, she felt a creeping fear that she might bring about the very chaos she wished to avoid.
One afternoon, the weight of her thoughts became too much to bear. After a particularly long day of research, Mari woke up from a nap, her mind swirling with the implications of her newfound abilities. She grabbed her phone and called Aurora.
Mari: “Aurora, I’m freaking out. What if this power… what if it’s dangerous?”
Aurora: “Mari, we’ll figure it out. You’re not alone in this. We just need more information.”
The two spent hours researching, combing through books and online resources, but each discovery only deepened their unease. It felt like the more they learned, the more questions arose. Eventually, they came across an old legend mentioning a woman named Corazon, rumored to have knowledge about powers like Mari’s.
The following day, they set off to find Corazon, arriving at an old, secluded house on the outskirts of town. As they knocked, they felt a strange, foreboding energy. When Corazon answered the door, her eyes pierced through them, knowing exactly why they had come.
Corazon: “You seek answers about your power. But remember this: every ripple has a cost. The more you try to control the storm, the more it may consume you.”
Her words lingered in Mari’s mind as they left, unsettled by the gravity of the situation. The weight of her powers felt heavier than ever, the responsibility growing more daunting with every moment.

Chapter 3.2: The Burden of Power



As Mari stepped into her house, her mind swirled with the weight of her new reality. She glanced back at Aurora, who gave her an encouraging nod before heading home. Mari knew she couldn’t waste any time; understanding her powers was crucial, and she needed to act fast.
Mari's House
Inside, Mari found her mother, Mary Luzviminda, sitting at the kitchen table, looking exhausted. The strain of raising Mari alone, coupled with the constant fear of the storms, had taken its toll on her. Mari hesitated, not wanting to burden her mother with her newfound abilities, but she also knew she couldn’t hide the truth forever.
Mary: “Mari, you look pale. Is everything alright?”
Mari forced a smile, trying to mask the fear coursing through her veins.
Mari: “Yeah, Mom. Just a lot on my mind. I’m going to my room for a bit.”
Mary watched her daughter disappear down the hallway, sensing that something was off but unsure how to approach it. Mari’s room was her sanctuary, filled with memories, pictures of her friends, and mementos of simpler times. She sat on her bed, staring at her glowing hands, trying to grasp the magnitude of her powers. Her thoughts drifted back to her visions—the flooded city, the screams, the helplessness.
House of Aurora
Meanwhile, Aurora returned home, her mind still reeling from everything Mari had revealed. She knew they had to act fast, but she also recognized that Mari needed a friend—someone to ground her amidst the chaos. Aurora gathered a few essentials, her thoughts lingering on Mari’s powers and the potential they held. She was determined to help Mari, no matter the cost.
City of Nectarville
In the city, the storm clouds that had once loomed ominously over Nectarville were gone, but the air remained tense, as if the city itself was holding its breath. Mari stood at her window, looking out at the streets that had once seemed so familiar but now felt foreign and threatening. The glowing in her hands flickered faintly, a reminder of the power she wielded and the heavy responsibility that came with it.
The Weight of Choices
Mari sat on the edge of her bed, the room’s silence pressing down on her like a heavy weight. The revelation from Corazon replayed in her mind—each ripple in time carried consequences she couldn’t predict. The gravity of it all was almost too much to bear.
Her gaze drifted to her glowing hands, a stark reminder of the power she now held. The idea that every choice she made could have far-reaching effects was both daunting and paralyzing. She could no longer see her life as it once was—simple and predictable. Now, every action, every decision seemed to carry a ripple effect she struggled to comprehend.
Mari’s phone buzzed on the nightstand, snapping her out of her thoughts. She picked it up with trembling fingers and dialed Aurora’s number. The line rang several times before Aurora’s voice, filled with concern, answered.
Aurora: “Hey, Mari. Is everything okay?”
Mari: Her voice strained and quivering: “I need your help. I’ve been thinking about what Corazon said. I can’t just ignore this. I need to do something, but I don’t know where to start. Can we meet up?”
Aurora: “Of course,” she replied immediately. “Let’s meet at the park. It’s quiet there, and we can think things through without distractions.”
As she ended the call, Mari felt a flicker of relief at Aurora’s willingness to help. As she prepared to leave, her eyes wandered to the framed photos on her bedside table—snapshots of simpler times with friends and family. They felt like a lifetime ago now, a stark contrast to the turmoil she was experiencing.
She stepped out of the house, her thoughts racing. The street outside was quiet, bathed in the soft glow of the evening. As she walked toward the park, she glanced back at her home through the window near the front door. Her mother, Mary Luzviminda, was still sitting at the kitchen table, her posture slumped and her face etched with deep, unspoken worry. Mari’s heart ached with the weight of the secret she was carrying. She wanted to protect her mother from the truth, but she knew she couldn’t keep living this double life.
With a deep breath, Mari turned away and headed towards the park. Each step felt heavy, laden with the weight of the choices she had to make. The park was a few blocks away, a sanctuary amidst the chaos of her life. As she approached, she hoped that the quiet and the company of her friend might offer some clarity in this swirling storm of uncertainty.
Mari arrived at the park, the cool evening breeze brushing against her face as she took in the familiar surroundings. The park, with its gently rustling leaves and the soft glow of streetlights, offered a momentary reprieve from the chaos swirling within her. Aurora was already there, sitting on a bench and scanning the horizon, her expression a mixture of concern and anticipation.
Mari approached, and Aurora looked up, her eyes reflecting a blend of empathy and determination. Without a word, Mari sat beside her, and for a moment, they simply sat in silence, allowing the tranquility of the park to settle their nerves.
Mari: Her voice barely more than a whisper: “I don’t know where to start. The weight of everything is just too much.”
Aurora: Placing a reassuring hand on Mari’s shoulder: “We’ll figure this out together. But first, let’s focus on what you need to do now. It’s clear that Corazon’s warning wasn’t just a precaution; it’s something we need to take seriously.”
Mari nodded, her eyes fixed on the distant horizon.
Mari: Voice tinged with worry: “I feel like I have this power, but I’m still just a kid. I don’t know how to control it or understand its full scope. What if I make things worse?”
Aurora: Squeezing her shoulder gently: “The fact that you’re aware of the potential consequences shows that you’re already thinking wisely. We’ll take it one step at a time. We need to explore what you’re capable of and find a way to use it responsibly.”
As they talked, the reality of their situation began to sink in. Mari knew that her powers had the potential to change everything, but she was unprepared for the responsibility that came with them. The fear of unintended consequences weighed heavily on her, and the thought of her relationship with Aurora being tested by her own actions was a sobering realization.
Aurora: "Hey, can we take a break from all this? You're just going to stress yourself out thinking about everything that's been happening. Let’s do something fun. How about I cook something delicious at my place?" 
She pauses for a second, then laughs. 
Aurora: "Oh wait, I forgot—I can’t cook! Hahaha."
Mari, shaking her head with a playful smile.
Mari: "Let’s just order food online and have it delivered here instead. All this thinking has made me hungry with everything going on around me."
Aurora: “Sounds perfect!”
Aurora pulled out her phone to place an order. When the food finally arrives, she leaps up with excitement, almost like a little puppy eagerly awaiting a treat. They find a cozy spot on a nearby bench and settle down, digging into their food.
As they begin eating, Aurora sighs, leaning back.
Aurora: "Okay, enough about all these crazy superpower things. Let’s talk about real life for a change. So… how’s everything going with you?"
Mari hesitates, her expression uncertain for a moment, but then a playful grin spreads across her face. 
Mari: "Oh, it’s going great! Actually, there’s this person who bought me a ton of food today, and it almost felt like we were on a date."
Aurora chuckles knowingly. 
Aurora: "Is that so?" 
She shakes her head, amused, clearly catching onto Mari's playful jab. Wrapping an arm around Mari’s shoulder. 
Aurora: "Alright, then. Tell me… what kind of dates do you usually prefer?"
Mari: "Watching movies, for sure. And it doesn’t even have to be in a theater. I’ve got my ChillFlix account, and I can set it up on the TV if you don’t have one."
Aurora: "Nice. So what genre do you go for?"
Mari: “Romantic ones.”
Mari starts scrolling through her phone, searching for movies with eyes bright. As she finds the romantic movies she’s already watched, she starts telling Aurora about them one by one—whether they’re musicals, stories of forbidden love, or tales of desperate passion, Mari recounts them all enthusiastically.
They both lean back against the bench’s backrest, their heads tilted upwards toward the sky, the atmosphere comfortable and peaceful. But after a while, Mari notices Aurora has gone quiet. Turning her head, she realizes Aurora has dozed off.
Mari: "Hey! You’re not listening to me!"
Aurora, still half-asleep, mutters.
Aurora: "It’s just so boring! All those love stories are so cliché. Why not throw in a tragic ending for once?"
Mari immediately protests, frowning. 
Mari: "No way! I can’t stand those sad, tragic movies. Don’t even think about making me watch something like that."
Aurora chuckles softly. 
Aurora: "Alright, alright. Don’t worry, I won’t make you suffer through that."
With that, the conversation drifts off into a peaceful silence, the two of them resting quietly under the sky, content in each other's company.

Together, they watched as the sun set over the park, the darkness encroaching as the day gave way to night. The park, once a place of solace, now seemed to symbolize the uncertainty of their future. Mari and Aurora’s friendship, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos, was now intertwined with the very powers Mari struggled to control.
With a final, resolute look at the horizon, Mari stood up.
Mari: Determined: “We need to figure out how to use my powers without causing harm. If we don’t, we might end up making everything worse.”
Aurora: Nodding, standing beside her: “We will. We’ll face this challenge together, and we’ll make sure that whatever changes we make are for the better.”
As they walked away from the park, their silhouettes merging with the encroaching darkness, Mari felt a renewed sense of determination. She knew that the path ahead was fraught with danger and uncertainty, but with Aurora by her side, she was ready to confront whatever lay ahead.
The weight of her choices was immense, but Mari was prepared to face the consequences. Little did she know that her next steps would lead her into a whirlwind of altered realities and strained relationships, pushing her powers to the limit and testing the very fabric of her existence.

Chapter 4: Premonition



(Aurora path)
The park was bathed in the soft glow of twilight as Mari and Aurora decided to head home. As they walked, Mari couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss. She had a sense of foreboding, a premonition that something terrible was about to happen.
Aurora: “Are you okay, Mari?” (concerned look) noticing the troubled look on her face.
Mari: “I’m fine.” (smiles) trying to reassure her but deep down, she knew she wasn’t.
They exchanged goodbyes and parted ways. As Mari reached the bus stop, a familiar chill ran down her spine. She remembered the night of the typhoon as she realized the same thing might happen again soon. She knew she had to do something to prevent it, but she wasn’t sure what.
She hopped on the bus and settled into her favorite spot at the back beside the window. Alone inside the bus, she thought of attempting to awaken her power, but to no avail; nothing happened. Overwhelmed by thoughts of her powers, she pulled out her headphones, hoping to distract herself from the intrusive memories that haunted her and started to drift off to sleep. But little did she know, her desperation to understand her powers and her constant thoughts of wanting to return to the time of the typhoon led her back to the nightmare she once experienced.
A wave of dizziness washed over her. When she opened her eyes, she found herself back on the night of the typhoon.
Mari: “I am back again on the day of the typhoon! I shouldn’t waste this time to modify the past once again.”
She rushed towards ESTIAI University, the floodwaters rising rapidly behind her. She had to save her friends, no matter the cost. The memory of their terrified faces and desperate cries for help was etched into her mind.
As she approached the university, the chaos was overwhelming. People were shouting, panic was setting in. Mari scanned the crowd, searching for her friends.
Mari: “I need to save my friends from drowning. I cannot afford to lose them again just like before.”
Aurora: “Mari! Over here! The water’s rising too fast! We’re trapped! Help us, please! We need to get out of here before it’s too late.”
Josh: “Mari, don’t give up on us! We’re stuck, and the water’s coming up so quickly. I don’t know how much longer we can stay here.”
Kurt: “Mari, hurry! The water’s getting higher, and it’s so cold. We’re losing our grip.”
Mari: “Don’t give up! I’m here!” Her voice barely audible over the wind.
But even though she had arrived early, the storm's intensity was overwhelming. The floodwaters were rising faster than she could have imagined.
Mari: “Think, Mari, think! There has to be a way.”
Mari's mind raced. She knew she had to find a way to save her friends.
Suddenly, the bus stopped and she woke up abruptly. The bus had come to a stop at a red light. Mari had been lost in thought, her mind wandering through the memories of her past dreams. Suddenly, she felt a cold sensation on her arm. She looked up to see Bellatrix and Ian, two notorious bullies from her school, standing over her.
Ian: "Well, well, well," he sneered.
Bellatrix: "Looks like you're in a bit of a pickle, Mari."
Mari tried to ignore them, but their presence made her uncomfortable.
Mari: "What do you want?" she asked, her voice trembling.
Ian: "Oh, nothing much. Just thought I'd come along and see how you're doing. Maybe even have a little fun at your expense." (he laughed)
Mari: "Leave me alone." (trying to sound confident)
But Bellatrix and Ian were not to be deterred. They started to question Mari about her dreams, mocking her for being so easily scared.
Ian: "What did you dream about, Mari?" (his voice dripping with sarcasm)
Mari tried to ignore them, but they persisted.
Bellatrix: "Come on, tell us," her eyes sparkling with mischief.
Mari hesitated. She didn't want to share her dreams with them, especially about her visions. But she knew that if she didn't, they would never let her go.
Mari: "I... I don't remember." (she stammered)
Bellatrix and Ian exchanged a knowing glance.
Ian: "Oh, really? That's a shame. I was hoping you had something interesting to share."
Bellatrix: "We know you're hiding something from us, Mari." (her voice low and menacing)
Mari tried to act calm, but her heart was pounding in her chest.
Mari: "What are you talking about?"
Ian: "We know you've been having weird dreams. And we know you're hiding something about your powers." (he smirked)
Mari's eyes widened in shock. How did they know about her dreams? And how did they know about her powers?
Mari: "How do you know about my dreams?" (her voice trembling)
Bellatrix and Ian exchanged a glance.
Bellatrix: "We have our sources."
Mari knew that she was in trouble. Bellatrix and Ian were blackmailing her. If she didn't tell them about her dreams and her powers, they would make her life a living hell.
Mari: "I don't know what you're talking about." (trying to bluff)
But Bellatrix and Ian were not to be fooled. They pushed Mari against the bus window and began to threaten her.
Bellatrix: "Tell us what you know, Mari, or else..." (her voice filled with menace)
Just as it seemed like the situation was going to escalate, she hurriedly got off the bus.
Mari sighed in relief. She was safe for now, but she knew that Bellatrix and Ian would not give up. She would have to be more careful in the future.
While walking, she thought about the scenario that had just happened.
Mari: "I need to tell Aurora about what I just dreamt about."
Mary Luzviminda’s voice filled the room as her daughter entered. "Welcome home, my daughter!" she said with a bright smile, her eyes reflecting a mother's joy. The scent of food filled the air, and without skipping a beat, she asked, "Have you eaten?"
Mari: "I'm not hungry yet."
Mary Luzviminda raised an eyebrow but kept her tone light. "Is that so? Go ahead and change over there so we can eat." She gestured toward a small hallway that led to Mari’s bedroom.
As Mari entered her room, the wooden floor creaked slightly under her feet. She glanced at her bed, neatly made, with soft linens that smelled faintly of lavender. She took her time, enjoying the familiar comfort of home.
Impatiently, Mary Luzviminda called from the kitchen, "Mari! What's taking you so long to change? Hurry up, or this food I cooked will get cold."
From inside the room, Mari responded, "Yes, Mom!" She quickly finished changing into more comfortable clothes and stepped back out into the cozy living room.
As she emerged, her mother was already at the dining table, adjusting the placement of the dishes. The food was laid out, steaming lightly, ready to be enjoyed. Mary Luzviminda looked up and said with a mock sternness, "Oh, just sit there and eat. Please turn on the TV; it's been raining a lot; there might be a storm."
Mari nodded and reached for the remote, turning on the old television in the corner. The screen flickered to life, and the low hum of the weather report filled the room. As the rain outside intensified, they began to eat together, the warmth of the meal contrasting with the cool, damp air outside.
The next morning, sunlight peeked through the thin curtains of Mari's room, gently stirring her from sleep. As she sat up, the events from the previous day on the bus flashed through her mind. Her heart raced for a moment, and she realized she had to leave early. Quickly, she got out of bed and hurried through her morning routine, pulling on her uniform and gathering her books. The house was still quiet, with only the faint sounds of the city waking up beyond the walls.


Chapter 4: Ripples of Destiny

(Aurora path)
Once outside, the cool morning air greeted Mari as she walked toward the school. The streets were damp from the previous night's rain, and a light breeze rustled the leaves. As she approached the school gate, she spotted Aurora and Josh walking together, talking and laughing. The sight of them side by side made Mari quicken her pace.
"Good morning, Aurora! And to you, Josh," Mari called out.
Aurora turned, her face lighting up with a warm smile. "Good morning!"
Josh nodded and echoed, "Good morning!"
Catching up with them, Mari suggested, "Let's go together."
The three of them walked through the school gates, their footsteps in sync as they made their way down the bustling hallway. Students were scattered everywhere, chatting, laughing, and rushing to their classes. Upon entering the classroom, Mari and Aurora immediately took their usual seats, Mari sitting beside Aurora.
After a few moments of silence, Mari leaned over, her voice low but urgent. "It happened again," she whispered.
Aurora turned to her with a curious expression, eyebrows furrowing slightly. "Which one?"
Mari sighed softly, her thoughts racing. "There are so many possibilities that could happen," she said cryptically, her eyes glancing out the window, as if lost in thought.
Aurora tilted her head, confusion etched across her face. "Like what?"
Just then, the teacher entered the room. Aurora quickly fixed her seat, glancing at Mari with a promise. "Later, tell me everything that happened."
________________________________________
The sudden blare of the school alarm echoed through the hallways, signaling the end of class. Students quickly packed their belongings, shuffling papers and notebooks into their bags as they prepared for the next class. The room buzzed with chatter and the scraping of chairs on the floor.
Aurora, however, wasn’t ready to let their conversation drop. She walked over to where Mari sat, deep in thought, and gently tapped her shoulder. "Now, tell me everything," Aurora said, her voice serious yet filled with concern. "We still have 20 minutes before our next class starts."
Mari hesitated, glancing around the nearly empty room before taking a deep breath. She began recounting her recurring dreams—strange, vivid visions of the future that felt more real with each passing night. In her dreams, she saw terrifying possibilities, disasters looming, and people she cared about getting hurt.
Aurora listened carefully, her expression growing more troubled with every word. "What will you do?" she finally asked, her voice barely above a whisper.
Mari shook her head, unsure. "I don’t know… but I’ll try to figure out the best thing I can do to save all of you," she said, her voice wavering with uncertainty. The weight of responsibility pressed down on her. What if she was too late? What if she made the wrong choice?
Aurora sighed deeply, her brow furrowing as she processed everything Mari had just said. After a moment of silence, she made a firm decision. "Okay, but I’m going to help you," Aurora said with conviction. "I can’t just stand by and let you deal with this on your own, especially if you're seeing something so terrible in the future."
Mari looked up, grateful but worried. “Aurora, this is dangerous. I don’t want to put you in harm's way.”
Aurora shook her head, her expression unwavering. “I don’t care. If lives are at stake, we need to do something. You’re not alone in this.”
Before Mari could argue further, Aurora suddenly grabbed her hand and pulled her. "Come on," she said with a small, encouraging smile. "Our next class starts in 5 minutes. Let’s focus on that for now. We’ll figure out the rest later."
They hurried out of the classroom, walking briskly down the bustling hallway filled with students. The air was charged with the familiar sounds of lockers closing and conversations mixing together, but Mari's mind was still swimming with thoughts about the future. Yet, with Aurora by her side, she felt a little more grounded, as if she wasn’t facing her fears alone anymore.
As they walked toward their next class, Mari couldn’t shake the feeling that something was coming—something big. For now, she pushed those thoughts aside, focusing on the sound of their footsteps echoing in the hallway and the comfort of Aurora’s steady presence next to her.
________________________________________
Entering History class, Mari and Aurora couldn’t shake the feeling that something was amiss. A sense of foreboding washed over them, a premonition that something terrible was about to happen.
"Do you think we might find answers in the library?" Mari asked, her voice barely audible over the noise of the hallway.
"Maybe. We could try looking for ancient texts or historical records. Something might be there," Aurora replied, her eyes filled with hope.
Once in the library, they were greeted by a quiet, serene atmosphere. Shelves filled with books loomed around them, their spines worn with age. Mari and Aurora began searching for ancient texts, hoping to uncover clues about Mari's powers and the strange visions she was experiencing.
Hours turned into days as they delved deeper into the library's vast collection. They discovered hidden passages, secret chambers, and ancient symbols etched into the walls. Mari felt a growing connection to the library, as if it held the key to unlocking her destiny.
One evening, as they were about to leave, a sudden gust of wind rattled the windows. A chill ran down Mari's spine as she felt a surge of energy within her. She knew it was time.
"Aurora, I think we need to go," she said, her voice barely audible over the howling wind.
"Let's go," Aurora nodded, her eyes filled with determination.
They rushed out of the library, the rain pouring down around them. The streets were deserted, save for the occasional flash of lightning. As they made their way towards the outskirts of the city, Mari felt a strange sense of calm wash over her, as if she was being guided towards something important.
Upon reaching the outskirts of the city, the scene starkly contrasted the peaceful campus they were used to. Floodwaters were rising rapidly, and people were panicking.
As they fought their way through the surging waters, Mari felt a surge of energy within her. In that moment, she knew their journey had only just begun.

(Josh path)
The park was bathed in the soft glow of twilight as Mari and Josh decided to head home. As they walked, Mari couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong. A sense of foreboding gripped her heart, a subtle but persistent premonition that something terrible was on the horizon.
Josh: “You okay, Mari?” (concern in his voice) noticing her distant expression.
Mari: “Yeah, I’m fine.” (forcing a smile) But deep down, Mari knew that was far from the truth.
They exchanged goodbyes as they parted ways, Josh heading toward his apartment and Mari to the bus stop. She sat at her favorite seat at the back of the bus, beside the window. A familiar chill crawled down her spine, reminding her of the night of the typhoon. The memory of the devastation weighed heavily on her, and she realized the unsettling feeling might be connected to it happening again.
Inside the bus, she thought of trying to awaken her powers, but nothing happened. Desperation clung to her mind like a fog, and as she pulled out her headphones to distract herself, exhaustion took over. The rhythm of the bus lulled her into an uneasy sleep.
Little did she know, her desire to understand her powers had pulled her into the same nightmare that once haunted her.
When she opened her eyes, she found herself back in the typhoon’s deadly grip.
Mari: “I’m back… It’s happening again! I can’t waste this chance to change things.”
Without hesitation, Mari sprinted through the rain-drenched streets, heading toward ESTIAI University. The floodwaters were rising faster this time, more dangerously. Her mind was filled with the terrifying memories of her friends — their desperate cries, their fear.
Mari: “I have to save them. I won’t let them drown. Not again.”
As she neared the university, the chaos was even more intense than before. People ran in every direction, their faces twisted in panic. Mari scanned the crowd, her heart racing.
Josh: “Mari! Over here! The water’s getting too high! We’re stuck, and we can’t get out!”
Aurora: “Mari! Help us! We’re trapped inside! We can’t stay here much longer!”
Kurt: “We’re losing our grip! The water’s rising too fast!”
Mari: “I’m coming! Hold on!” She shouted, though her voice was almost drowned out by the storm.
Despite arriving earlier this time, Mari could feel the intense pressure building. The floodwaters were closing in, faster than she could react.
Mari: “I have to think… think, Mari! There has to be a way.”
Just as the tension reached its peak, the bus jolted to a stop, snapping Mari awake. Her heart raced as she realized it had all been a dream—or a vision. The bus had stopped at a red light, and Mari rubbed her temples, trying to shake the remnants of the dream. But her respite was short-lived.
She sensed the shift in the air. As she glanced up, she saw Bellatrix and Ian, two notorious bullies from her school, approaching.
Ian: (mocking) “Look who’s daydreaming.”
Bellatrix: “You look like you’ve seen a ghost, Mari.”
Mari tried to keep her cool, but her hands trembled slightly.
Mari: “Leave me alone.”
Ian: “Oh, don’t be like that. We’re just here for some fun,” he smirked, leaning closer.
Bellatrix gave her a sly look. “You’ve been acting weird lately. What’s on your mind, Mari? Scared of a little dream?”
Mari’s heart skipped a beat. How could they know?
Mari: “It’s none of your business,” she muttered, trying to sound unfazed.
Ian narrowed his eyes. “We know you’ve been having some… strange dreams, Mari. Want to tell us what they’re about? Or should we start guessing?”
Mari stiffened, realizing they somehow knew about her visions. She quickly stood up, pushing past them.
Mari: “I don’t owe you anything.”
The bus doors opened, and Mari hurried off before they could push her further.
Breathing a sigh of relief, Mari continued walking home, her thoughts swirling. She had to talk to Josh about this. Maybe he could help her figure it out.
When she finally arrived home, her mother’s warm voice greeted her.
Mary Luzviminda: “Welcome home, my daughter! Have you eaten?”
Mari: “I’m not hungry yet,” she replied softly, her mind still distracted.
Mary Luzviminda: “Go ahead and change, then. We’ll eat when you’re ready.”
Mari smiled faintly before retreating to her room, the familiar comfort of home easing her tension. But her mind remained occupied with the events of the day — the dream, Bellatrix and Ian’s ominous behavior, and what might come next.
After changing, she joined her mother at the dinner table, but the conversation was light, her focus elsewhere. The next morning came quickly, and Mari woke with renewed determination.
________________________________________
Outside the school, the streets were damp from the previous night’s rain. As she approached the gate, she spotted Josh waiting, leaning casually against a tree.
Josh: “Morning,” he said with a smile.
Mari: “Morning. Ready for another day?” she asked, trying to act normal.
As they walked into the school together, Josh could tell something was off.
Josh: “You seem distant. What’s going on?”
Mari took a deep breath and pulled him aside.
Mari: “I had that dream again, Josh. The one about the typhoon… but it’s more than a dream, isn’t it?”
Josh’s expression turned serious. “You’re sure? That it’s not just a dream?”
Mari nodded. “I know it sounds crazy, but I think it’s a vision… I think it’s going to happen again.”
Josh didn’t doubt her for a second. “Alright, then we figure this out. Together.”
________________________________________
As the day wore on, Mari and Josh snuck away to the library, determined to find any clue about the strange occurrences. They scoured old records, flipping through pages filled with arcane symbols and forgotten lore.
Josh leaned closer to a dusty tome. “There has to be something in here about your powers, Mari. Some way to stop what’s coming.”
The library’s old wooden shelves creaked as they searched, finding hidden passages and forgotten texts. Hours passed, and soon it was evening.
Mari: “We’re running out of time.”
A sudden gust of wind shook the windows, and a familiar chill settled over her.
Mari: “Josh… I think it’s time.”
They rushed out into the storm, the winds howling around them as they pushed through the rising floodwaters. The city was falling into chaos, but Mari felt a strange calm, knowing Josh was by her side.
Together, they braved the storm, but Mari knew deep down, their journey had only just begun.





Chapter 5: Revelations/Exodus (climax)

CLIMAX
DECISION 1: AURORA'S PATH
The storm raged on, and in that moment, Mari made her final choice.
Without a second thought, she grabbed Aurora's hand, pulling her towards the staircase that led to the fourth floor of the building. They had no time to waste. The floodwaters were rising fast, and the structure was already groaning under the strain of the storm.
As they reached the landing of the fourth floor, the chaos was worse than they had anticipated. The windows had shattered, and rain poured into the hallways, turning the floor into a slippery mess. Papers and debris flew around them as the wind howled like a living beast, threatening to tear the building apart.
Aurora (panting): “Mari, we’re almost there! We just need to make it to the roof!”
But before they could take another step, a familiar figure emerged from the shadows, blocking their way. Bellatrix Wilkes, the girl who had tormented Mari for as long as she could remember, stood in front of them with a wicked smile. Her drenched hair clung to her face, and her eyes glinted with malice.
Bellatrix (mocking): “Going somewhere, Mari? You really think you can escape this? You think you can save everyone?”
Mari’s heart sank. Of all the people to show up now, it had to be her.
Mari (gritting her teeth): “Get out of our way, Bellatrix. This isn’t the time.”
Bellatrix (smirking): “Oh, but it is. You’ve always thought you were so special with your powers, didn’t you? But look at you now. You’re as helpless as the rest of us.”
Aurora stepped forward, her voice steady despite the fear in her eyes.
Aurora: “We don’t have time for this, Bellatrix. Move, or we’ll make you.”
Bellatrix laughed, but there was no humor in it. The storm raged outside, a reflection of the tension building inside.
Bellatrix (sneering): “Make me? You think you can just run up to the roof and fix everything with your little powers? You’re a joke, Mari.”
Mari felt a surge of anger rise within her. She was done with being afraid, done with being tormented by Bellatrix.
Mari (firmly): “You don’t understand what’s at stake, Bellatrix. This isn’t about us. It’s about everyone.”
Bellatrix (coldly): “I don’t care. You’ve always had everything, and I’ve had nothing. If this city drowns, so be it. At least I’ll be free of you.”
That was it. Mari had had enough. Without warning, she lunged forward, her fist connecting with Bellatrix’s jaw. The impact sent Bellatrix stumbling backward, slipping on the wet floor and falling hard. For a moment, the world seemed to pause as Bellatrix lay there, unconscious, her body limp.
Mari’s chest heaved with emotion as she looked down at the girl who had made her life a living hell. Despite everything, she couldn’t leave her here to die.
Aurora (softly): “Mari… let’s go. We don’t have time.”
Mari nodded but knelt down beside Bellatrix, slipping off her jacket and draping it over her fallen enemy. Even now, in the midst of everything, she couldn’t let her humanity slip away.
Mari (quietly): “I don’t hate you, Bellatrix.”
She stood up, her resolve solidifying. Taking Aurora’s hand once more, they rushed up the final flight of stairs, their destination in sight.
As they reached the rooftop, the full force of the typhoon hit them. The wind howled, rain lashed at their faces, and the city below was nearly unrecognizable, swallowed by the flood. But Mari wasn’t focused on the storm anymore. She had made her choice. She knew what she had to do.
The storm raged on, and in that moment, Mari made her final choice.




DECISION 2: JOSH PATH 
The storm raged on, and in that moment, Mari made her final choice.
Without hesitation, she grabbed Josh’s arm, pulling him up the stairs. They both moved quickly, their footsteps echoing in the empty building as they raced toward the fourth floor. The floodwaters were rising, creeping higher with every passing second, but Mari knew they couldn’t stop.
As they burst through the door to the fourth floor, the chaos they encountered was overwhelming. The windows were shattered, allowing torrents of rain to pour into the hallways. Water pooled on the ground, mixing with broken glass and scattered debris. The storm raged outside, making the entire building tremble beneath its force.
Josh (panting): “Mari, we’ve got to hurry! We can’t stay here much longer!”
Mari nodded, determined. The roof was just one more flight of stairs away, but as they made their way toward the stairwell, they found someone waiting for them. Out of the shadows, a figure stepped forward — Bellatrix Wilkes. Her wet hair was plastered to her face, and a look of cold satisfaction gleamed in her eyes.
Bellatrix (smirking): “Going somewhere, Mari? You really think you can just run from this? From me?”
Mari froze, her heart pounding. Bellatrix had always been a problem, but now, in the middle of this disaster, she was the last thing they needed.
Josh (in disbelief): “Bellatrix? What the hell are you doing? This isn’t the time for your games!”
Bellatrix’s grin widened as she stepped closer, blocking their path.
Bellatrix (mocking): “You’ve always thought you were better than me, Mari. You and your stupid powers, always thinking you could fix everything. But look around you! Look at this city. You can’t save it. You can’t save anyone.”
Mari clenched her fists. She didn’t have time for this, but the anger bubbling inside her was hard to contain.
Mari (firmly): “Get out of our way, Bellatrix. This isn’t about us.”
Bellatrix (taunting): “Isn’t it? You’ve always had everything, Mari. Friends. Power. People looking up to you. And what do I have? Nothing. If this city drowns, at least I’ll be free of you and your perfect little life.”
Josh stepped forward, his frustration mounting.
Josh (angrily): “We don’t have time for this! If you want to stay here and drown, fine! But we’re not going to die with you.”
Bellatrix (mocking): “Die with me? Oh, please. You’re not going anywhere.”
Before either of them could react, Bellatrix lunged forward, trying to grab Mari. Instinctively, Josh stepped in front of her, shoving Bellatrix away. The force sent Bellatrix stumbling backward, her feet slipping on the wet floor. With a gasp, she hit the ground hard, her head making a sickening thud against the concrete.
For a moment, everything went silent.
Josh stared at Bellatrix’s motionless form, his chest rising and falling rapidly.
Josh (breathless): “Mari, we… we’ve got to go.”
Mari hesitated, looking down at Bellatrix. She had always been cruel, always a thorn in Mari’s side, but seeing her like this — vulnerable and unconscious — sent a pang of guilt through her.
Mari (quietly): “We can’t leave her here.”
Josh (urgently): “Mari, she’s dangerous. We don’t have time to save everyone.”
Mari bit her lip. He was right, but something inside her wouldn’t let her leave Bellatrix behind. With a sigh, she knelt down and pulled her jacket off, covering Bellatrix’s limp form to protect her from the rain.
Mari (whispering): “I don’t hate you, Bellatrix. I never did.”
Standing up, she turned to Josh, her decision made.
Mari (determined): “Let’s go.”
Without another word, they dashed toward the stairwell and climbed the final flight of stairs to the roof. The full force of the typhoon hit them as they emerged, the wind and rain battering their bodies. The city below was a sea of water, buildings barely visible beneath the rising flood.
But Mari wasn’t focused on the destruction. She knew what she had to do. She had made her choice.
The storm raged on, and in that moment, Mari made her final choice.


FOUR POSSIBLE  endings:
(Aurora path)
Decision 1. Sacrifice Her Lover – Save the Town and Herself
 
The storm clouds churned violently above the city, and the rooftop of the STI building groaned under the weight of the rising winds. Mari stood with Aurora by her side, her glowing hands trembling. They had been through so much together—discovered powers, faced danger, and clung to each other in the darkest moments. Now, they stood on the brink of a choice that would forever alter their lives.
 Mari’s heart felt as if it were being torn apart. She could see the city below, drowning in floodwaters, and the cries of the people echoed in her mind. She had the power to rewind time, to stop the storm, to save everyone. But there was a cost, and that cost was Aurora.

 Aurora looked at Mari, her expression filled with a painful resolve. She stepped closer, gripping Mari’s hand tightly. “Mari, you have to do it,” Aurora whispered, her voice barely audible over the roar of the storm. “You can save them all. You can save yourself.”

Mari shook her head, tears spilling down her cheeks. “I don’t want to live without you. I can’t.”

 
Aurora smiled softly, though tears filled her eyes too. “You have to. It’s the only way. If I’m gone, you’ll survive. You’ll stop the storm, and all of this—” She gestured to the chaotic scene around them. “—it will have been for something.”

 “But… Aurora, I love you.” The words fell from Mari’s lips, desperate and raw.


“I love you too,” Aurora whispered, stepping closer and cupping Mari’s face in her hands. “And that’s why you have to let me go. For the greater good.”

 
Mari hesitated, her heart screaming in protest, but she knew Aurora was right. She had the power to fix everything, but it would come at the most unbearable price. With a choked sob, she raised her glowing hands.

 “I’m so sorry,” Mari whispered, her voice breaking as she prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice.
 
The moment her powers surged, time unraveled around them. Aurora’s face blurred, her body fading away like mist in the wind. Mari tried to hold on, but it was like grasping at air. In a flash, Aurora was gone—her love, her partner, erased from existence as if she had never been.


The storm ceased, the floodwaters pulled back, and the city was saved. Mari collapsed to her knees on the now-quiet rooftop, sobbing uncontrollably. The world was at peace, but her heart was shattered. She had saved everyone—everyone but the one person she couldn’t live without.
Mari stands atop the ESTIAI University building, witnessing the destruction caused by a devastating typhoon flooding the city of Nectarville. Her hands glow with the power of time manipulation, a power she has used repeatedly in failed attempts to prevent this disaster. Despite rewinding time countless times, every attempt brings her back to this exact moment, where she faces an impossible choice.



Decision 2. Sacrifice the Town – Save Herself and Her Lover
 
The winds howled as the floodwaters climbed higher, engulfing everything in their path. Mari and Aurora stood on the rooftop of the STI building, watching in horror as the city was swallowed by the storm. Time was running out, and Mari could feel the pressure mounting in her chest. She had the power to stop this, to save the city and its people—but the thought of losing Aurora was too much to bear.

Aurora’s hand tightened around Mari’s, her eyes pleading. “Mari, you can fix this! You have to stop the storm!”

Mari shook her head, her breath coming in short, desperate gasps. “No. I can’t. Not if it means losing you.”

Aurora’s face contorted in shock. “What? Mari, think about what you’re saying! There are thousands of people down there. You can save them! You have to!”

But Mari couldn’t. The memory of Aurora’s smile, the warmth of her embrace, the laughter they had shared—it was all too precious. She couldn’t let that go. She couldn’t live in a world without Aurora, even if it meant condemning the town to destruction.


“I won’t do it,” Mari said, her voice cracking. “I can’t lose you again, Aurora. I’d rather—”

Aurora’s eyes widened in disbelief. “Mari, no. You can’t sacrifice all those people for me. Please, don’t do this.”

But Mari was already stepping back, her glowing hands dimming as she made her decision. “I’m sorry, Aurora. I need you. I need us.”

The storm surged, stronger and more violent than ever before. The waters swallowed the city whole, drowning homes, cars, and people. Mari’s heart ached as she heard the distant cries, but she didn’t move. She couldn’t.
As the floodwaters rose to the rooftop, Mari wrapped her arms around Aurora, pulling her close. “We’ll survive this, together,” she whispered, her voice trembling with fear and guilt. 
Aurora, torn between anger and heartbreak, clung to Mari, knowing that the choice had been made. They watched as the city was consumed, the devastation complete. In the end, they were the only ones left—together, but at a terrible, irreversible cost.
Aurora, by her side, urges Mari to act and use her powers to stop the storm, but Mari is torn. Each option she considers carries an immense cost—whether it's the city, her friends, or Aurora herself. Mari's fear of losing Aurora conflicts with her duty to save the city. With the storm intensifying, the floodwaters rising, and the cries of those trapped below growing louder, Mari realizes she has no time left to hesitate.
 
Decision 3. Sacrifice Herself – Save Her Lover and the Town
 
The wind howled, the floodwaters surging beneath them. The rooftops of the city were barely visible as the storm bore down with unrelenting fury. Mari and Aurora stood on the edge of the STI building’s roof, their clothes drenched from the rain. Mari’s hands glowed with an eerie light, the power within her screaming for release.
“I can’t let this happen,” Mari murmured, more to herself than to Aurora. She turned to face her, her heart heavy with the weight of the decision she knew she had to make. “I have to stop the storm. But… I have to do it alone.”
Aurora shook her head, panic filling her eyes. “No, Mari. We can figure this out together. There has to be another way.”
“There isn’t.” Mari’s voice broke. She stepped toward Aurora, her hands still glowing with the power that could change everything. “The only way to save the town, to save you, is for me to give up… everything.”
Aurora’s breath caught in her throat. “What do you mean?”
 
“If I sacrifice myself,” Mari whispered, her voice shaking, “I can stop the storm. I can rewind time and prevent it from ever happening. But I won’t be here when it’s over. I’ll disappear, Aurora.”
 
“No!” Aurora cried, grabbing Mari’s hand and pulling her close. “You can’t do that! You can’t leave me! There has to be another way!”
 
Mari closed her eyes, tears mingling with the rain on her face. “I love you. More than anything. But this is the only way to save you, to save everyone.”
 
Aurora’s voice cracked as she begged, “Please, Mari. Don’t leave me. I can’t do this without you.”
 
“You’ll have to.” Mari’s heart broke as she stepped back, her hands glowing brighter, her power reaching its peak. “I’m doing this for you. For the town. I can’t let everyone die because of me.”
 
The world seemed to pause as Mari raised her hands. The glow became blinding, and the air hummed with energy. Time itself bent to her will as she made the ultimate sacrifice.
 
Aurora reached out, tears streaming down her face. “Mari, no!”
 
But it was too late. In a brilliant flash of light, the storm stopped. The winds died down, the floodwaters receded, and the city was saved. Time had been rewound, and the disaster had never happened. But Mari was gone.
Aurora collapsed to her knees on the rooftop, the silence of the storm’s aftermath pressing down on her. Mari had saved them all, but she had vanished, erased from existence. The girl who had loved her, the girl who had fought so hard to save the town, was gone forever.
Alone on the rooftop, Aurora sobbed, clutching the spot where Mari had stood just moments before. The city was safe, the storm was over, but her heart was shattered. Mari had given everything to save them, and now she was nothing more than a memory.
The pressure of the decision weighs heavily on Mari, as she fears that no matter what she chooses, someone will be lost. She is scared and unsure, but Aurora reassures her that she must trust herself and make the choice. As the storm reaches its peak and time pulls at her, Mari understands that she can no longer run from this decision. With her heart breaking, she looks at Aurora one last time and makes her final choice.
DECISION 4 (Josh path) 
The wind roared like a beast unleashed, tearing through Nectarville as the typhoon raged on. Mari stood at the top of the ESTIAI University building, her hands glowing with the familiar yet overwhelming power of time. The floodwaters below were merciless, swallowing buildings, streets, and lives. Destruction was everywhere.
Beside her stood Josh, his face pale but determined. He glanced at Mari’s glowing hands, knowing that this power was the only thing that stood between the city’s salvation and its complete annihilation. He’d seen Mari struggle before, watched her rewind time, trying desperately to change the course of events. But each attempt had only brought them back to this rooftop, to this moment.
Josh (shouting over the storm): “Mari, you have to do something! This storm is going to take everything!”
Mari’s heart raced, her mind clouded with panic. She had seen this moment in her visions too many times—countless rewinds, countless failures. No matter how hard she tried, the future always dragged her back here, to this rooftop, to this impossible decision. The weight of it was unbearable.

Mari (shouting back): “I’ve tried, Josh! I’ve tried everything! Every time I rewind, it gets worse. No matter what I do, it all leads back here.”

Her voice cracked as the glow from her hands flickered, the raw power surging within her. She had rewound time so many times that it felt like her soul was being torn apart by the consequences. And now, standing here with Josh, she felt trapped, powerless to change the inevitable.

Josh (grabbing her arm): “You can’t give up! You’ve come too far. You’ve saved us before, Mari. You have the power—use it!”

Mari turned to face him, her best friend, the boy who had been there through everything, standing beside her even as the world crumbled around them. She had never wanted this. She never wanted the burden of deciding the fate of so many lives. The city, her friends, Josh—how could she possibly choose between them?

Mari (her voice shaking): “What if no matter what I choose, I lose someone? What if I can’t save you? What if I can’t save anyone?”

Josh’s grip tightened on her arm, his eyes full of determination despite the fear that lurked behind them. Josh: “You don’t have to figure it all out right now. We don’t have time for that. But what you can do is trust yourself. You’re the only one who can stop this.”

The wind howled louder, urging Mari to act. Below them, the floodwaters continued to rise, swallowing everything in their path. The city of Nectarville was already half underwater, and the people trapped below screamed for help that might never come. Every second they waited was another second closer to complete devastation.

Mari (panicking): “It’s happening again. Just like in my vision… It’s all happening again.”

She took a step back, her eyes scanning the horizon, the chaos unfolding below just as she had seen it before. Every detail was the same—the destruction, the fear, the helplessness. Time was slipping away, and she knew that she had no more chances to rewind. This was it.

Josh (urgently): “Mari, we’re running out of time! You can’t freeze up now—you have to act!”

Mari could feel the pressure mounting, the storm closing in around them. Josh was right—there was no more room for hesitation. But every choice she saw before her felt like a trap. If she used her powers again, who would she lose? Who would be sacrificed this time?

She turned to Josh, her heart breaking. Mari (softly): “I’m scared.”

Josh’s expression softened, but there was still determination in his eyes. Josh: “I know you’re scared. But you’ve faced worse before. You can do this. You’ve always been the one who could change everything.”

Mari’s mind raced, her thoughts spinning like the storm around them. She could feel the weight of each decision pressing down on her, pulling her in different directions. No matter what she did, there would be consequences. And no matter what choice she made, someone would be lost.

She glanced at Josh, his face full of trust, his belief in her unwavering. He had always stood by her, always believed in her, even when she doubted herself. But now, as she looked at him, she knew that this might be the last time they stood together.

Mari (whispering): “How do I choose? who  to save?”

The glow in her hands flared brighter as her power reached its peak. She could feel the storm fighting back, a force of nature as unstoppable as time itself. The wind whipped around them, the floodwaters rising higher, threatening to engulf the entire city.

Josh (desperate): “Mari, please! Whatever you’re going to do, do it now!”

The moment of decision loomed before her, as vast and terrifying as the storm itself. Mari knew that this was the end—the moment she had been running from. She couldn’t rewind anymore. She couldn’t run from the responsibility that had been placed on her shoulders.

Her eyes met Josh’s one final time, knowing that whatever she did next would change everything.

The storm raged on, and in that moment, Mari made her final choice.
