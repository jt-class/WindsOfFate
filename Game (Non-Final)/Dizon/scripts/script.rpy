    mari "The park was bathed in the soft glow of twilight as Mari and Aurora decided to head home."
    mari "As they walked, Mari couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss."
    mari "She had a sense of foreboding, a premonition that something terrible was about to happen."

    show aurora concerned at right
    aurora "Are you okay, Mari?"
    mari "I’m fine. Trying to reassure her, but deep down, she knew she wasn’t."

    mari "They exchanged goodbyes and parted ways. As Mari reached the bus stop, a familiar chill ran down her spine."
    mari "She remembered the night of the typhoon as she realized the same thing might happen again soon."
    mari "She knew she had to do something to prevent it, but she wasn’t sure what."

    scene bus_interior with dissolve
    mari "She hopped on the bus and settled into her favorite spot at the back beside the window."
    mari "Alone inside the bus, she thought of attempting to awaken her power, but to no avail; nothing happened."
    mari "Overwhelmed by thoughts of her powers, she pulled out her headphones, hoping to distract herself from the intrusive memories that haunted her and started to drift off to sleep."
    mari "But little did she know, her desperation to understand her powers and her constant thoughts of wanting to return to the time of the typhoon led her back to the nightmare she once experienced."

    
    mari "A wave of dizziness washed over her. When she opened her eyes, she found herself back on the night of the typhoon."
    mari "I am back again on the day of the typhoon! I shouldn’t waste this time to modify the past once again."

    mari "She rushed towards ESTIAI University, the floodwaters rising rapidly behind her. She had to save her friends, no matter the cost."
    mari "The memory of their terrified faces and desperate cries for help was etched into her mind."

    show aurora trapped at center
    aurora "Mari! Over here! The water’s rising too fast! We’re trapped! Help us, please! We need to get out of here before it’s too late."
    
    show josh trapped at right
    josh "Mari, don’t give up on us! We’re stuck, and the water’s coming up so quickly. I don’t know how much longer we can stay here."

    show kurt trapped at left
    kurt "Mari, hurry! The water’s getting higher, and it’s so cold. We’re losing our grip."

    mari "Don’t give up! I’m here!"

    mari "But even though she had arrived early, the storm's intensity was overwhelming. The floodwaters were rising faster than she could have imagined."
    mari "Think, Mari, think! There has to be a way."

    scene bus_stop with dissolve
    mari "Suddenly, the bus stopped and she woke up abruptly. The bus had come to a stop at a red light."
    mari "Mari had been lost in thought, her mind wandering through the memories of her past dreams."
    mari "Suddenly, she felt a cold sensation on her arm. She looked up to see Bellatrix and Ian, two notorious bullies from her school, standing over her."

    show ian smirking at right
    ian "Well, well, well."

    show bellatrix sneer at center
    bellatrix "Looks like you're in a bit of a pickle, Mari."

    mari "Mari tried to ignore them, but their presence made her uncomfortable."

    mari "What do you want?"
    ian "Oh, nothing much. Just thought I'd come along and see how you're doing. Maybe even have a little fun at your expense."
    mari "Leave me alone."

    mari "But Bellatrix and Ian were not to be deterred. They started to question Mari about her dreams, mocking her for being so easily scared."

    ian "What did you dream about, Mari?"
    mari "I... I don't remember."

    bellatrix "Oh, really? That's a shame. I was hoping you had something interesting to share."
    ian "We know you've been having weird dreams. And we know you're hiding something about your powers."

    mari "How do you know about my dreams?"
    bellatrix "We have our sources."

    mari "Mari knew that she was in trouble. Bellatrix and Ian were blackmailing her."
    mari "If she didn't tell them about her dreams and her powers, they would make her life a living hell."

    mari "I don't know what you're talking about."

    bellatrix "Tell us what you know, Mari, or else..."

    mari "Just as it seemed like the situation was going to escalate, she hurriedly got off the bus."
    mari "Mari sighed in relief. She was safe for now, but she knew that Bellatrix and Ian would not give up."
    mari "She would have to be more careful in the future."

    scene home_interior with dissolve
    mari "Mary Luzviminda’s voice filled the room as her daughter entered."
    mary_luzviminda "Welcome home, my daughter!"
    mary_luzviminda "Have you eaten?"

    mari "I'm not hungry yet."

    mary_luzviminda "Is that so? Go ahead and change over there so we can eat."

    mari "As Mari entered her room, the wooden floor creaked slightly under her feet."
    mari "She glanced at her bed, neatly made, with soft linens that smelled faintly of lavender."
    mari "She took her time, enjoying the familiar comfort of home."

    mary_luzviminda "Mari! What's taking you so long to change? Hurry up, or this food I cooked will get cold."

    mari "Yes, Mom!"

    mary_luzviminda "Oh, just sit there and eat. Please turn on the TV; it's been raining a lot; there might be a storm."

    mari "Mari nodded and reached for the remote, turning on the old television in the corner."
    mari "The screen flickered to life, and the low hum of the weather report filled the room."
    mari "As the rain outside intensified, they began to eat together, the warmth of the meal contrasting with the cool, damp air outside."

    mari "The next morning, sunlight peeked through the thin curtains of Mari's room, gently stirring her from sleep."
    mari "As she sat up, the events from the previous day on the bus flashed through her mind."
    mari "Her heart raced for a moment, and she realized she had to leave early."
    mari "Quickly, she got out of bed and hurried through her morning routine, pulling on her uniform and gathering her books."

    scene street_morning with dissolve
    mari "Once outside, the cool morning air greeted Mari as she walked toward the school."
    mari "The streets were damp from the previous night's rain, and a light breeze rustled the leaves."
    mari "As she approached the school gate, she spotted Aurora and Josh walking together, talking and laughing."
    mari "The sight of them side by side made Mari quicken her pace."

    mari "Good morning, Aurora! And to you, Josh."

    show aurora smile at right
    aurora "Good morning!"

    show josh smile at center
    josh "Good morning!"

    mari "Catching up with them, Mari suggested,"
    mari "Let's go together."

    mari "The three of them walked through the school gates, their footsteps in sync as they made their way down the bustling hallway."
    mari "Students were scattered everywhere, chatting, laughing, and rushing to their classes."

    mari "Upon entering the classroom, Mari and Aurora immediately took their usual seats, Mari sitting beside Aurora."

    mari "After a few moments of silence, Mari leaned over, her voice low but urgent."
    mari "It happened again."

    aurora "Which one?"

    mari "There are so many possibilities that could happen."

    aurora "Like what?"

    mari "Just then, the teacher entered the room. Aurora quickly fixed her seat, glancing at Mari with a promise."

    aurora "Later, tell me everything that happened."

    mari "The sudden blare of the school alarm echoed through the hallways, signaling the end of class."
    mari "Students quickly packed their belongings, shuffling papers and notebooks into their bags as they prepared for the next class."

    aurora "Now, tell me everything. We still have 20 minutes before our next class starts."

    mari "Mari hesitated, glancing around the nearly empty room before taking a deep breath. She began recounting her recurring dreams—strange, vivid visions of the future that felt more real with each passing night."
    mari "In her dreams, she saw terrifying possibilities, disasters looming, and people she cared about getting hurt."

    aurora "What will you do?"

    mari "Mari looked out the window at the gray sky, a determined expression settling on her face."
    mari "I’ll find a way to stop these visions from becoming reality. I have to."
